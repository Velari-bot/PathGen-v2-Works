Pros and Cons of EOR

EOR On Pros:
- Faster edits
- Smooth and flashy
- Good for montage clips
- Good for creative

EOR On Cons:
- Bad crosshair placement
- Harder to piece control

EOR Off Pros:
- Good crosshair placement
- Easier to hit shots when you box fight
- Easy to do right-hand peaks (like Peanut butter edits)

EOR Off Cons:
- Slower
- More buttons to click
- Harder to do flashy edits fast

It is hard to switch once you pick whether to use EOR or not and requires a lot of training to edit fast again!

At the end of the day you should be using edit on release to strictly improve, once you've gotten the peaks and angles down with it, its 100% more worth it then Edit on release off.

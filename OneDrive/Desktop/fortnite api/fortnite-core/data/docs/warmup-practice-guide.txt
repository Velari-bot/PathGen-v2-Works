Warmup and Practice Guide

Try always to warm up no matter what they will improve your game a lot.

Always try to practice your weakness.

Do not scroll on Twitter mindless as it leads you to lose valuable time in your life + You see other people succeed which is not mentally good for you.

Do not scroll tiktok and say its productive.

When you Die actually think how you died.

Each time you get into a fight think how can i take the least amount of damage this make you place smart and not play out of emotions etc and run at them blindly.

Mechanics training v5 has one of the best warmup routines and best routines to improve in fortnite.

WARMING UP

As well as warming up in Fortnite (mechanics) you should also warm up in real life. This includes warming up your wrists with simple wrist movements like rotating them and making sure you have move them without pain or hassle. Also you need to go into tournaments with a good mindset. This means you shouldn't scroll twitter, TikTok etc. Instead have self belief and do something that makes you happy aka praying or being kind.

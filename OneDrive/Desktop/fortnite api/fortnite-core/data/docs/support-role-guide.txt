A support player should not be selfish, putting the team first, and need to best situational awareness possible.

If your IGL needs to plan a rotation or 'play', you can continue tarping while they do so to prevent getting trapped back zone.

If being hard sprayed make sure to support them, this can be by heals, etc.

Carry heals multiple heals (apart from 2 weapons)

Make sure to tarp if needed, for example when the IGL is creating a plan/rotation strategy

Shoot back if being sprayed and help heal up your teammates

You need to be carrying all shields, mobility, and weapons, and need to be flexible with your loadout, adapting to what the team requires.

If you want to win offspawn, you need to make good callouts and pickup ideal items. You should land at areas with more loot.

Perfecting the Support Role in a Competitive Fortnite Trio

Prioritize Team Utility Over Personal Stats

Your main job is to enable your teammates. That means always thinking about the team first—carry heals, extra materials, and mobility items like Dash Sprites. Be ready to drop loot quickly in clutch moments and make sure your fraggers are always topped up.

Master Resource Management

The support should be the one keeping track of materials, ammo, and healing across the team. In between fights or while rotating, ask for and redistribute resources to make sure everyone is balanced. Great supports are like walking supply drop they keep everyone alive and fighting at full power.

Stay Close and Aware

You need to stay close enough to your teammates to help instantly, but not so close that you all get beamed at once. Your positioning is key use natural cover and builds to keep line of sight on your team. Always be looking out for who needs help and where the threats are coming from.

Be a Clutch Reviver and Anchor

Supports are usually the ones who stick behind during a fight to revive downed teammates or build layers of protection. In stacked endgames, you might not always be on the front line, but you are the reason your team makes it to the next zone. Stay calm under pressure and keep your builds clean and efficient.

Aim Training Guide

To improve your aim you MUST aimtrain there is no fast way or easy way.

The best aimtrainer in the world is Kovaaks (You can get it on Steam). No matter your skill level its 100% worth it to invest about $6-$10 on kovaaks. Make sure to do this before you start playing Fortnite.

Controller players i do not care how good your aim is. Aim duelling with make it 10x better. You must aim duel daily to see improvements or as often as you can.

Controller aim training allows you to control better how you look and how your thumb should respond to aim assist toggling (on/off). It allows you to learn to loosen your thumb's movement on the right stick when it activates, and tensing the movement when the aim assist deactivates. So you are "trying to aim less accurately with your thumb in a way" when it toggles on, and you "start aiming well with your thumb" when it turns off.

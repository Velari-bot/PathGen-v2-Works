Tarping Guide

There is multiple ways to tarp in Fortnite (list below):

- Straight Tarp (normal tarp straight walls to both sides and floor and top)
- Diagonal tarp (Tarping diagonally making sure your covered but not building inside of your tarp)
- Upwards tarp (using ramps above and beneath you and walls to either side to switch layers)
- Cone tarp (using a wall to one side and an edited cone to the other with a floor to preserve mats. Remember to always block your tarp off behind you so you don't get snuck up on.

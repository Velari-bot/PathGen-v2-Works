Storm Surge in Competitive Fortnite

Storm Surge is a crucial mechanic in competitive Fortnite that punishes passive players by dealing damage to those with the lowest total damage dealt when too many players are alive in a match. To avoid being affected by Storm Surge, you need to be active in dealing damage throughout the game.

Early Game Strategy
- If you're a strong fighting team, you should W-key an opponent early to secure damage and eliminate them. This guarantees Storm Surge tags and sets you up for a better mid-game.
- If you prefer a passive playstyle, focus on getting Storm Surge tags from safe positions. Set up bases on high ground near common rotation paths, allowing you to tag players moving into the next zone.

Mid-Game Positioning
- Continue tagging rotating players from storm surge bases at elevated positions where you can see multiple teams.
- Avoid unnecessary fights but make sure you're consistently dealing damage to stay above the Storm Surge threshold.

End-Game Storm Surge Strategy
- If you still need Storm Surge damage, look for opportunities to pre-edit walls and force damage on opponents.
- The player with the lowest ping should handle pre-edits to ensure they take the enemy wall on the first attempt before making an aggressive play.
- Edit smartly—don't overexpose yourself when going for Storm Surge damage, as you can get focused by multiple teams.

By staying aware of your damage threshold, positioning correctly, and capitalizing on pre-edits, you can avoid Storm Surge and ensure a strong endgame position.

Storm Surge has changed

Instead of damage done its now net damage this means thresholds are lower than normal. If you dont take any damage you will stay above for the game. This means you need to keep yourself protected. If your good at fighting W-Keying means you can take more damage later in the game or you can play ultra safe and stay protected.

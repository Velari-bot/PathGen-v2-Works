Bad Habits Guide

There are many good habits to have, but there are also many bad habits. In here, you will find bad habits along with what they are, and how to fix them.

Over Peeking

This is the most common mistake between boxfighting and general fighting. Overpeeking occurs when you make an edit, but aren't behind the edit. This makes it so that your opponent can shoot you instantly, while you have to wait for your shotgun to pull out. This allows a free shot by the enemy and enough time to block off your shot. 

To fix this mistake, use edit on release off. This is mainly for keyboard but if you have it off, you make an edit and don't confirm it until you are behind the safe portion of the wall. If you don't want to or can't adapt to edit on release off, keep it on but make sure to hold the edit until you are behind cover.

Taking left hand peaks

In Fortnite your character is positioned on the left hand side of your screen. This causes lower visibility on that side of the screen. Because of this, if your sitting on left hand peek it will be harder to hit a shot. Additionally, in Fortnite you hold weapons in your right hand meaning more of your shots will connect on a right hand peek than a left.

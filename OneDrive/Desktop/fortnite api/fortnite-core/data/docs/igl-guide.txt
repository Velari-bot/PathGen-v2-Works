IGL - In Game Leader Guide

Be aware of terrain and zone at all costs. If you are aware of your surroundings it can give a huge advantage as it can help with rotating. For example, mountains and bushes, if you can make a path when rotating you are ahead of everyone as you are aware of the enemy teams.

Focus on rotating on the dead side of zone, this is super beneficial as you can look for launchpads, materials and heals. You also need to make sure on dead side you have cover so you won't get focused.

Positioning is very important as an IGL especially midgame, you need the to prioritize good and safe positions. Ideally you don't want to stay in an area where you can get focused easily, or W-keyed but you still want to have good awareness of your enemies.

Patience is virtue. Remember to take fights that you are supposed to. Don't take bad ones that will leave you in a disadvantage.

Tips for IGLS

Learn from coaches! You can check out coaches in the howtogetcoached channel.

Do VOD reviewing as much as you can! You can learn from your own mistakes and also learn what your doing well and be more consistent in that! You will also find out what you need to improve on.

Do not let fights ruin your game! Remember its your job as IGL to give instructions and if you give out a bad one learn from it later on during VOD reviewing.

Remember: It's your job to stop teammates from doubting your bad decisions mid-game. If you make one learn from it later, Don't let it affect your game!

As a leader you shouldn't go and die first. Support your teammates when pushing, Don't go push by yourself or let your teammate do the same.

Pay attention to zones and make good calls and rotates. Be aware of your own tarp and others! You don't want to get into a fight were you are at a disadvantage!

Remember that just because you are the IGL doesn't mean you don't work with your teammate! Chemistry is KEY in teammodes!

What fights do you take?

- Enemy keys offensively to you or your position
- Enemy has low health in 3rd party situation but from far away you should finish off to get eliminated points
- You are close enough to one teammate away from his duo or rest of the team
- You are in early game with higher health and better drop of weapon and mats (especially if you open a rare or seasonal loot chest like Elemental chest and get good loot the enemy is in close proximity as you like in the same building)
- Knowing you have a loot, mat and health advantage in general

IGL Checklists

Early Game
- Have a good offspawn plan (dropmaps, rotations, gameplans, lootpaths)
- Loot up! Get enough mats, heals and loot
- Stay alert for early game pushes. Be prepared to fight them off and remember to conserve your mats and heals

Mid Game
- Decisions can lead to the endgame, Make your decisions clear and easy to understand
- Forecast Towers - These towers are packed with players during the midgame because of the huge advantage this can give during endgame, making you one step ahead of the enemy. You can either rush in and rush out getting the forecast quickly OR you can clean everyone else out taking third parties and getting free surge.
- Loot Island - You can get a lots of heals and mats for endgame, giving you a full refresh for endgame.
- Remember to get surge, refreshes, and a good position so you can get a good path of zone and a good sight of the lobby.

Late Game
- Find a good layer to fight at which you and your teammates are good at.
- Use cones to find out where people are and find the safest route before rotating
- IGLs should learn tarping. In trios or duos its your role to lead the tarps and rotates.
- You need to look for the best eliminations and refreshes for you.
- Have communication with your teammates. Give calls and tell your ideas.
- Be confident and support your teammates. You and your team should be supportive and calm. DO NOT FIGHT because it will totally destroy your game and maybe throw your tourney

Ranked Guide

The more damage to higher your rank - get surge on those knocks.

Killing a person a higher rank will give you more points/ higher rank.

Eliminations that you get when less people are alive will give more chance of a rank up.

Bronze silver gold platinum lobbies: 1 kill is worth 2%, When in top 25 and they are worth 5%. 

Diamond elite and champ lobbies: 1 kill is worth 1%, When in top 25 it is worth 3% and a win is worth 5%.

In lower ranks, play for elims and raise your rank quicker. Beyond elite ranks, placement matters more. Even In W key games in these higher ranks, you will increase a slow net percentage (particularly from champion rank) so play for placements and less aggressively. Also; you risk losing percentage higher and the cost to your grind effort is much more, in the higher ranks, those fewer lost % are harder to grind back than losing a lot of % in a lower ranks and gaining them back. Simply, don't lose rank in higher leagues or it's much harder to grind back up.

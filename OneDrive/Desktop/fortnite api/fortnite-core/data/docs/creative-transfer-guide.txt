Tips on how you can transfer your creative skills to real games

Most Fortnite players have a lot of skill against random people in a creative game but it doesn't transfer to in-game fights. Take creative more seriously and in fights pretend that if you die. You've lost a game in a cash cup. Then you will might more confidently in game.

Don't play fully aggressive in creative games because you definitely won't in cash cup or in pubs, whether noob or pro.

Play every creative game like a ranked game. And remember that the more practice isn't always better, as for your practice you need to be working on things you are not as good at, instead of just wasting time practicing thing you know you are already good at.

Don't do flashy retakes or stuff in creative that you won't do in real game it's highly unrealistic since it's wasting mats, editing too fast and losing real concentration, and toxicity (flexing, emoting, etc. Instead, You should play more Ranked and Scrims to get more realistic practice.

Refreshes Guide

What Are Refreshes?

Refreshes involve eliminating opponents to gain their resources, essential for sustaining yourself in long matches.

Refresh Techniques and Strategies

- Position yourself among the first teams to reach the front side of the first zone. This strategic placement allows you to hold back opponents in the rear, creating opportunities for eliminations and refreshes.

- Identify weak or inattentive players using audio cues or players building in wood. You can often tell when someone is desperate for a refresh by their erratic movements or the fact that they're hiding instead of building aggressively. Target these players for a quick elimination.

- Use pre-edits as an effective tactic to secure one or more quick refreshes.

- Don't just jump into a fight for a refresh without thinking. Wait for the right moment, such as when an opponent is distracted, low on health, or engaged with another player. Striking at the perfect time will increase your chances of securing a refresh without taking much damage.

- Don't chase a player even if you deal 180 damage on them. Good positioning is more important than refreshes. Instead of chasing them be calm and try to get a better position. While rotating you may run into another player and be able to get a refresh from them.

- Go for a refresh when you have little mats. If you go too early, its a waste and if you go too late you may die to the opponents.

- Fight for the refresh as a team, don't have one player look for it.

- Secure eliminations quickly and loot efficiently.

- Tarp a bit ahead when going for loot backside

Timing and Execution

- Be mindful of the storm and plan escape routes post-refresh.

Wall taking

Taking a wall is very important in a fight, especially when someone is low and healing.

Pre Tips

Ping: If your ping is below 50 then you have a 50% chance of taking the wall with perfect timing

Practice: Practice makes perfect. Also patience too! Don't hesitate to wait longer to perfectly prefire or rush and fire early when the enemy is approaching your wall or you are against their wall damaging it, so YOU end up shooting the wall, wasting shells.

When? Generally only push a wall when you have a health advantage

Tips

Health: Use a shotgun when a wall is newly placed to quickly get it to low hp, allowing you to take the wall with 1 pickaxe swing.

Pressure: You can apply pressure with a spray weapon which will deal pressure and damage to the wall.

Make them scared: Above tells you to do damage with a spray weapon. This allows you to make sure that they will be scared to edit on you.

Right hand: Have a right hand peek when you take the wall so you're ready to edit instantly.

Predictability: Don't double swing in one go so they can predict you and prefire you.

Health of a wall: If the wall is low (below 40 health at least) you can use a shotgun and instantly wall-replace.

Confusing the enemy: Strafe and jump around in front of the wall of the enemy whilst damaging it and don't stand still so they can prefire you easily if they need to.

Team strategy: One member can be shooting and damaging the wall while the other is being ready to place the wall.

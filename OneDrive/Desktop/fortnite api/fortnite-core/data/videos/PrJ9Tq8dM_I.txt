yo what is going on everybody my name is Marin TM and welcome back to a brand new video here on the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about how to stay motivated to grind and become the best in fortnite guys yesterday's video already has 880,000 views after only 16 hours I don't know what to say other than we truly started off 2021 incredible and I appreciate you guys so so much if you are enjoying the content please consider subscribing and liking the videos it really helps out so much more than you think with that said let's get started with with today's episode starting this video off we all know that being demotivated is something that happens from time to time and it's quite a fight to be able to pull through and find that inner motivation to grind again whether that be Sports school or fortnite and what I find interesting about all of this is that for me there's nothing I would rather do to make YouTube videos and reach my goals but even though that's the thing I enjoy the most in the world sometimes I just don't have any motivation I have read a lot about this recently and I think I have found the magic cure for the problem problem so let's get into it firstly set reachable specific goals and guys let's be honest you all knew that this was going to be a tip in this video but let me explain a little bit further and listen carefully because setting goals in fortnite can be very difficult because what should you aim for there really isn't anything in fortnite that will give you a daily dose of motivation so I thought I would give you a few things that you can work towards Arena arena is a great way to get daily motivation and you might be thinking I'm talking about setting goals for arena points but honestly setting Arena Point goals can be severely frustrating and is something I definitely would not recommend to anyone watching because getting arena points does not at all mean that you are becoming a better player what I mean by that is that if you play placement every single day and don't get into any fights then yes obviously you will get more arena points but it's going to be very boring and you're not going to improve at all as a player so rather than going for a set amount of arena points go for high kill wins this will ensure that your practice is both fun and effective secondly set a goal of how many matches you want to play per day for instance 10 Arena matches every day what I want you to do is to keep track of those games and how many of those games you die off spawn and see if you can lower that rate day by day because I can guarantee that when you see those results you will feel rewarded for the effort you put in meaning you will get more motivation it is a little bit of work but it is really really fun and motivating to see the progress second find a motivation trigger this can be anything but have you ever seen something on YouTube that just gets you fired up and ready to achieve all of your goals well I have and for me it is the fortnite video that goes by the title buga stories from the battle bus and I don't know why but I can watch that video every single day and find motivation in it your motivation trigger can be something completely different but I would recommend finding something you find interesting and inspiring and use that as a source for motivation what's important is that you watch your motivation trigger in this case bugas stories from the battle bus and then immediately after you're done you hop on and start playing what often happens when somebody's demotivated is that they don't feel like they're getting anything back from what they're doing and this is all a part of the process every successful human being has been in this spot but what the difference is between someone who has made it and someone who is still struggling to find motivation is usually the fact that the demotivated ones feels bad for themselves as Arab one of the hardest workers within the fortnite community said the world doesn't care about your circumstances nor does it owe you anything once you learn that you will be successful and I would recommend you to pause the video right now and think about that for a good second because those words alone can singlehandedly get you pretty far in anything in life moving on visualize yourself achieving all your goals this is something I do every day without exception doing this gives me an incredible drive to work even harder today than I did yesterday for me it's simple my goal is to be able to buy a beautiful home with an amazing view where I do YouTube full time I'm sure this thought alone is the reason I have come as far as I have because I know I can achieve it if I just work hard enough your goal can obviously be whatever you want it to be visualize your bank account winning the fortnite World Cup or even qualifying for it next up seek out the similarly motivated if you can find someone that is a motivation machine a person that plays to become the best no questions asked then that is your lucky charm having somebody like this is super rare because normal people and normal players they settle they settle for being okay or pretty good but you don't want to be okay do you you obviously want to become the best and if you guys have a friend with the same strive for greatness as you do then it gets so much easier you guys' positivity and mentality will affect each other and you'll both become Two ultra motivated players if a guy works on something for 50 hours and you do it for 100 hours who will become the best at that thing the answer to that question isn't necessarily you because life it isn't fair in this scenario you can either sit down and start crying about how unfair it is that this guy is better than you with half the effort or you can get up and practice like no one else try new things find the meta and outwork him what a lot of people fail to realize is that fortnite is a once in a lifetime opportunity that you're going to regret not taking seriously when you're older this is a thought process that gives me a lot of motivation to grind I don't ever want to be 40 years old looking back at my younger years thinking what I could have been I'm not afraid to go all in on this because I know that with the correct work ethic mentality and capacity then Anything is Possible the thought of me being 40 working at a supermarket honestly scares me enough to be motivated so just for a second think how grinding fortnite YouTube or twitch today can set you up for a beautiful future because there is a lot of money and potential involved and I'm definitely not saying that you should give up on other things in your life to grind the game but instead of watching Netflix or sleeping all the time get up and give yourself a real chance to become someone good lastly in this video I want to talk about how mental health is significantly associated with motivation mental health and how you feel is incredibly important and that's why sometimes taking a break going out with friends and family and just logging off is the best thing you can do to get back the motivation you once had mental health is to be taken seriously and some of the things I have done to improve my mental health and focus is to have a solid sleep schedule where I sleep 8 to 10 hours per night this will drastically improve how fast you learn and your focus when playing meaning you will be seeing results faster and then hopefully gain motivation because of the continuous improvements eating and staying hydrated also plays a big role when it comes to focus Improvement and mental health eating four to five times a day is a lot but it is recommended for the best environment for improvement and mental health in addition to all of this going to the gym is life changing not only will you begin to look fresher but you will also get a lot of mental Clarity because of the gym trips and this is something I honestly more than recommend if you implement all of the things I have said in today's video and you're still not motivated to become the best then that's on me I feel like I've gone over everything I've done to become incredibly motivated and this is what has worked for me I hope you guys found this video enjoyable and informative my name is Marin TM and I'll see you guys very very soon stay safe and take care trying to put me on a shorty want me so bad do your knees see you later yeah you catch me on a gas I'm a racer I'm a racer yeah yeah little shy always out of Molly you ain't really

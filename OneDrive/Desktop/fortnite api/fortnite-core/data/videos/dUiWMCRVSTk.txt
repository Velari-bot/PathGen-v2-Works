Today I coached my biggest fan in the solo cash cup. He told me that he's been competing for the last 2 years and still has not earned. So I decided to live coach him, pointing out all of his simple mistakes so he can learn as much as possible. Without further ado, let's get straight into it. Let's check this for this guy. Your con here for zone, brother. All right. This guy has no mobility, by the way. Just Yeah, just slide in. Slide in. Use walls to walk your back. You're good. He's not even [ __ ] with you. Look ahead. Look ahead. He has a bat. Just go underneath that search base. Like you run right right to it. Just white line. What a goblin, bro. You're good. Just building. Slide down here. Nice. Almost in. Fox box. I agreed that a little too much. You're good. [ __ ] bro. I think what you should do right now is chop into this old base and chop the guy out on height. Like go now. Just get into the base. Don't worry about this guy. Up one though. Chop from up one. At least one up. Go for it. Go for it quickly. You maybe get a kill here. He's gone. Okay, let's rotate. Same thing. I would just go to that bush on the edge. You see it? Just pump clear as you go. Like pump and spray it. All right, look ahead here. You need to go I would go left here. You see that old brick in the old wood? No, no, no, no, no. Closer. Way closer. Old brick and old woods. Follow that guy. You see the guy rotating right there? Yeah. Go to the old brick and then see the big bunch of [ __ ] in front of you. The open cone. Go to this. Just rinse repeat. Go right. Go right. Go right. Pop your mini and go into that [ __ ] to your right. Just need to use these old builds to break through for like temporary cover. Just break. Obviously care for someone being in here, but it's unlikely. Guy above you. Probably on his force. [ __ ] bro. I'm just so unaware, bro. I heard him, but like I mean, yeah, you saw his visuals and you saw him editing and I saw it obviously. I just didn't think you were going to run in there. I'm not going to lie. I thought he was like, I'm [ __ ] bro. [ __ ] No, but not not that it's a bad thing. I'm not trying to harp on a on like a fault of yours, but yeah, your awareness is pretty bad. Like, no, I aware the guy the guy the guy getting next to you, I don't know how he got there. I didn't see him. Maybe maybe I should have seen him. I I don't know how he got there, but either way, like that and then just the simple com maybe it's just an unn normal thing for you to do, but just like you knowing that you farmed the brick like and there's extra brick and then there's still a bit of the brick left that you didn't farm. It's just like you got to [ __ ] plug your brain in. Like you got to you got to know there's two cats there. You farmed one of them, you farmed the other one partially, which means you gave extra break, you dropped it, and you have some HP left and you have two chests to farm for wood. It's just like being really stingy with your mats near you. How to maximize what you have in your hand. And then yeah, the guy getting on you, whatever. That's kind of okay. And then that entire way like when you're sliding down to zone, you're like I don't think that first one when you first first load the guy had the bat. I think that was probably fine. Like you got in whatever. Yeah. And then you chop the guy out and took way too long. Yeah. You took a little bit of time on that one. It's it's fine though. And then when you scouted, you hardly scouted. I told you to clear the bush because that's that's your threat point. And you like looked behind you as if someone was going to come behind you, but there was no like I was not worried about that at all. There was no one behind you. There was no audio cue. Like I don't know what triggered in your brain to like turn around and start building ramps behind you as you're like sliding down. But again, the threat point was in front of you like and you hadn't even cleared it yet. So like you're basically sliding with your back checking behind some checking to see behind you. You know what I'm saying? While somebody could be in that bush ready to just absolutely fry you. [ __ ] on me. Yeah. So, it's got to be like no one's no one's around me. I know that for a fact. If you don't know, I guess you could do that, but you got to clear that bush. And then once you get to the bush, quickly scout and look closer to you, right? Like I I marked it. Told you I told you what like was there. You want to use those old builds. Like the play for that was the right play, but execution was the smoothest. Horrible. But essentially, you have no mobility. So, you have to just rat through old builds. Use old builds as cover. Slide down, get to that brick base, then go across the road, get to the get to where you died. like you did the right play was the right best thing you could do with no loot this game. Just get your loot, hit that marker next time so you can actually go for kills like or go for something. I don't know where that marker puts you, but if you actually hit the marker, you'll know you'll have a better drop. Good way to check the marker, by the way, is whenever you pull your glider, just quickly look straight down. It doesn't change your speed, doesn't change your angle. Just look straight down and you'll see where you pulled your glider and you'll know if you're ahead of it or behind it. So, right when you pull your glider, watch this. Oh, your glide was pretty bad. But now you're good. At least you know, right? You can see you were on the side of it. Yeah, you got out dropped. Wrong marker. So, do what you know best. Get your extra loot, clean the fight, whatever you want to do. Pump and auto. Still fighting. Dead. He left an auto in that box. He had to have. He definitely left an auto in that box. I'd go back and get that auto. You have a lot of the piece there. I don't know where it is. He's whited. Nice. Is he holding the auto? No, he wasn't. I don't know where the hell it went. Doesn't matter. Yeah, it's all good. I don't know if you if you knew this as well. I'm just piecing this up and letting you like going over my knowledge as I'm learning the spot for a first time, right? All right. Yeah. So, like there the guy's fighting. It's a shotgun fight. You hear it. We both process it. Boom. We know what's happening in the inside. Then you come in the inside. You see like nothing's farmed because it's likely that nothing was farmed cuz it was such a fast fight. So you should know that that guy's likely only has siphon mats cuz he just got a kill. He maybe has three builds off a chest that he didn't have to use. So like, you know, calculate that with how much ammo you're spraying or how many builds you see build like, okay, that's he now he's on brick. That's okay. Now he's on metal, you know, and then you just know there there it just happened to be perfect, right? You just sled in. He was already weak and he actually had no builds. But these things can like help you. Yeah, I didn't even think about that. You're right. make faster decisions off spawn. Start to peel for extra loot. This is your issue last game. This is what you want. Whatever. Whatever you want. I mean, it looks like nobody landed on the other side. I think you're fully like the where you landed was should be uncon the other side of that. And this looks looted. You hear a guy farming and you see the ammo's gone. So, I'd go back to where you landed and loot the west side. That's something you could have seen, too. You should have seen that ammo was taken long before you even got to it. All right. So, now this other side's looted cuz you see a footstep. It's a good play. Take height. Better just run this kid down, bro. Like, what in the [ __ ] is that? Thanks, G. That was a bug, I think. Yeah, it was. I mean, you know, this whole place is is looted already. Just go back for what you know for extra extra. Yep. Also, small other tip, just as I'm learning you go up there, the guy can't see your ramp. So, when you build, right, think about when you built that wall, the stair you sat on, whatever. He guarantees knows you're right there. He He knows he sees you building that ramp. He knows you're going to be on it versus just building up there and not building up top yet. And then you get a free shot. Yeah, you get a free shot. You peek over, fry him for 60. Key him. Then you can build. Probably go to shrine. Try to get a blue guy. No blue guy. You get a white guy. Put him in. Get some extra heals. I'm playing Storm this game. Also, I don't know the spot again, but I would be cautious of people behind you like this. I know there's a lot of split drops back here and it's solos and people love landing at like little huts. There you go. There's one guy. Could be a free kill. I don't think he did. Uh, he might have. It's just so laggy. So hard to hit people. Is this how it was in Grants? Uh, no, not really. Yeah, you see that? There's just so many split drops on this part of the map. That like little hotel in the top right corner. All the little splits are on Demon Dojo. Like, there's always going to be someone on your north now. You should be a good. Like, I'm pretty sure there's less splits over here. Yeah, there's like one split. Maybe like one or two. There's a guy here. Definitely pop your med kit. Try to kill this guy. He's been in here for longer than you. Kill him. Yeah. I didn't even know I was in there. Hell no. There's a shrine in front of you. You should try to grab barrels to your right. I like pop pop medkit or pop your medkit carry minis. Just spam your mobility to get out. I bet this again like map knowledge. Oh, I'll go down here. There should be one chest spawn. Oh, nice. It's here. Let me see if the barrels are here. Oh, perfect. Barrels are here. Boom. Got it. I just sp the wrong thing on accident. You're good. Okay. It's fine. Just check for a blue guy or a white guy or extra heals. Someone left on the shrine. Blue guy right there. Is there nice? Please don't run from me, buddy. Map knowledge. You should know this brick here is pretty bad. So, I wouldn't even waste your time. and and you're already playing a side, so I would just keep going right side here. You're low key. You're going to probably come out right at Lone Wolf, which is not a horrible play cuz there's a pad. That's where I would try to go out at extra loot. You probably grab some extra [ __ ] Here's some more mats that are actually good. Both close. Could use this river to get all the way center, but I need to find some whites. Check the roof. Could be someone sitting right above you right now. Awareness. Everything you go into that's unknown has to be cleared. Over a hill. Unknown on the other side of the hill. Got to clear it all. Got to see everything. Go into roof. Got to check all the angles. Check the top. Make sure no one's in there. You can mantle through and like send it, but Huh. Yeah, I would. I would. Yeah, you can mantle through those walls and get inside like, but right when you get in, you got to check just in case the guy's a bad reaction. He's about to jump on my Yeah, he's probably about to fry you. Use your mobility to get to this next bush here all the way down the river. Clear it. And you haven't checked your left here at all. There's a guy your back left popping minis [Music] chilling. Don't pop a bomb. My minis. Yeah, probably worth it. Probably drop your minis here. See two stacks, right? Grab this brick. You want on the way back at least. I mean, now you know if you're farming in the open, you get tagged. You just use your brick here. You got extra brick and extra minis. Doesn't even doesn't affect you at all. As long as you don't get hit for whites, you're good. You don't need You don't need this much brick. All right, let's look ahead here. Pretty sure there's a bush above you on this hill. I'd go to that. Yeah, let's go to that. Build up. Clear it though. Clear it. This the bush you wanted me to get in or not? Yeah, this is good. You start I think you're good here. I'll just start farming the gas station. You have 30 seconds to capture wood in here. Ammo box you can get. Good floors. I just that another ammo box. All right, let's look through this door here, the double door, and see if we got to rotate. Like, you probably just want to bush hop. So, find the next bush in front of you. There's one right there. Say there's a player in that, though. You can still go in the bush, though. All right, use your hands here. Get across Get across the street. Go left here. Go left here. You mean under the mountain? Yeah, this is Yeah, this is fine. Just use your mobility, though. Let's go. You're in the You're in the open farming wood. You're going to burn your minis. Let's go. Let's go. Keep going. Triangle of death right now, right? You're all open. No rearm. Got to burn. There you go. Now, let's get deeper. Maximize sprint slide. Could be guy in here, but I don't see visuals. You should be good. Good. Maximize sprint slide bush in front of you. That's your end goal right here. You're good. Keep going. Clear the bush. Let's go. You haven't cleared your top left of the mountain here. Behind you. Yep. All those guys that could be up there. Pop your minion and let's hope. Look at zone here. Nice. You're in a good spot. Just get some tags here and you're ready for next. But I don't know why I'm playing like feel like like my brain just off today. Bro, you can shoot his feet in a second. Just sit here. You're in a good spot. Oh, he's boxing up. Look ahead of you. See if you can maybe go some more center. I mean, low key, you could just hand under the bridge here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And get to that transition. More left here. his hands. All right, you just ran right into this guy's pray. You know what I'm saying? Versus you should have been here right where you are right now 5 seconds ago. Just get to this house. I would save your hands from now on. By the way, little fight awareness on the back there. You're you're think about everyone like look at your map here. Just look look at look at the rot edit this wall here and just look behind you. Also, please stick a wall behind you real quick so this guy doesn't piece you. Please stick a wall. Okay, so you're farming those trees, right? You put a wall to your left, but no wall behind you. Where's everyone going to come in from? Anyone coming from your left there? Behind you, right? Perfect line of sight to you. You're farming the tree that you're on right now that's already broken. Didn't block your back. Like, you're asking to just get tagged and then you're going to freak out when you get tagged and it's just going to be a cycle. It's just think about where people see you. Simple. They're going to they're going to come from behind you. This guy, your goal, your goal here is needs to be low-key just get above this guy and sort hand down like more left towards the using the train tracks if if it pulls that way. You get what I'm saying? So just edit your edit your thing. Jump down over this cone here. Maybe put like add the next one to a stair. Jump down. Boom. Build some walls. And just be prepared to box some wood. It's okay to burn like 100 wood on this next rotate if you can get past this guy. Um I would do that. I would go for it. Go up and over. Yep. Jump down. And there you go. Ideally, you don't hit the rail there. Walk your back here. You only have like one hand charge left. You need to get down. Lo to the river. You're good. Charger sprint. Get down to the river. Perfect. Don't use your hand. Don't use your hand. You have one charge left. Now remember, someone's going to come behind you. That's like your only worry right now. There he is. You go up and over this guy if you want. Or you can box here on top of this like pretty much right where you are. Box here. Box here. And like you can go back to these wood like use bit a bit of wood slowly. Let's see what this guy does. Chilling. Probably want to build a box. Up and in. Up and in. Now you're on the same layer these guys when it's good. Just just chill. Put a floor on your thing. Up and in. Means you would have you would have spent two more walls cuz you would have wanted to block this cone off, right? So, but now you would have been a layer up. Find these trees and look these trees. Good. Just give it time. This is that when you see a patch of trees too and you see your closest zone clicks again in your head. Boom. Okay. Okay, I'll just box in these in this tree even though I'm not in right now and I'll tarp with wood to the next tree and then I'll farm it and like you know what I'm saying? That process could have been done already. I know I didn't tell you to do that, but it's kind of a quick decision thing just to do it. And then yeah, the up the up and in gives you the same thing. You're getting inzone. You're just spinning extra wood on two walls or brick. This guy just gave me the best. You understand the up and in? Yeah. Yeah. Now you're waiting for these guys on your lair to go in front of you. Or else you Yeah, you'd go up one fall and then train. You could grief this kid. Definitely can grief this kid. Let the train pass. Don't get fried from their teams. Last train part. This is just max full. Holy [ __ ] up your blue guy. Max him like fully use him. This guy rotated. Look more right. You lowkey need to go either up down if you can. Like what? I would You're probably going to have to go down here. You're probably going to have to like jump down to the water and play it and get across the other side here. You need to I I would try to cross this. You go down here and just try to run on the river. There's one guy in metal here. Scare. Watch for him to box you. You can box. You box pop mini. But blue guy, you just need to cross here to the land on the across your way here. Let's go. Just run across the water, box this brick if you want. Cap your brick and then just run up this coastline. Just watch builds in front of you. Remember, someone's going to be on your back here in a second. Perfect. Yep. New hands. Nice. Okay, start to burn them. Go up this hill here. Up and over. You see these wood stairs? Left. You're on them. There's a guy up here, but you're good. Maybe one guy on your back here. You're good. He doesn't want to fight you. Watch your wood here. Okay. You're good. No one's on your back. Let's go. Look ahead. Need to pop minis. This guy needs something. Trying to kill you. See you get cracked. He's going to He's going to make you rotate for you. Just follow his builds. Care for the bush. Just so hand hand. Keep following this guy's bills and hand. H hand. Keep going. More right. More right. It's perfect. You're on a build. Isn't someone here? No. Let's go. Get in. More right. More right. You don't have to hand this. You just run this or that. That's fine. Build. Build. Build build. Build build. Turn around real quick. like reset your stay here so you can look back. I like flip it the other way. Sorry. I just want to show you. Look how look look at the box like to your left here. You didn't build on you slid past. Look, you would have been in zone. You were you came in a box past it and you're ass fried. Pop a blue guy here. Like you see how you got to you got to stop. Like you're going to get this is this is reason why I bring this up is cuz you do this often. You keep going. You like Yeah. You greet it like super heavy but you're already in there. All right, let's go. Should be just follow these old builds here. See that big tree to your right? Big tree to your right. Go right. Go right down towards the middle. You see it? Let's go. What are you doing? Let's go down to the middle. Hands straight down. Right past this wood ramp right below it. Keep going. Hands. Max it out. Get to these old builds in front of you. There's a guy right here. But these walls just finished. These are good. Box right here if you need. Going towards the middle. You're going right in between everybody. Okay, good. Go more right side here. Hard right side. Perfect. Right down. White line. White line. Perfect. You're in boxing this brick. Nice. Good. Stare them off. Stare them off. Just reverse there. Reverse there. There you go. Hold to you. I need to get up first. Right. I'll just wait for a second. I think what you should do here, I think personally two metal walls and then go up one like do like a really cheap 90 right now. Two metal walls up and then cone and then edit through and then build a box above it. You're just climbing up really cheaply. Don't build a wall. Yep, you're doing good. Go up now. build a box. See, you made a really supported way to get up higher. Now you're up a lair. You understand this? Yeah, I got you. I got you. I understand. Now you're Now you're chilling. Now you go Now you do the same thing you did earlier. You just go out your cone here, put a stair, and just make sure you don't like use your hands to go low ground. Just dash up. Get in your cone here. It'll be easier. You can follow these builds. Don't Don't rush yet. I'll okay right in the middle care. Perfect. You're in zone here. Just play this spot in zone. You're like very very edge. So like get ready to tank a bit or maybe it pulls back. If it pulls left here, you see the rotate. It's just either up and over or straight left of this wood floor. You see it? You're rotated straight left of this wood floor if it pulls that way. All right, it did. Just wait. Go now. Careful going center. Stay left of this guy. Good reading like I just [ __ ] did. No, you're good. Relax. Maximize your blue guy. You can make you can make like a cheap space here, like a stair tarp or a stair and a cone or something. Just like really cheap space. Make an extra box here so you can have more space to play off of more timing. or full blocks. That's fine. Just make it a space. You're going to use this to go. Nice. See, left it right here in this bush. Play for a kill. Push for a kill. Push for a kill. Yep. Give me more. Nice. Get in. Oh, I'm on your AR, but you got it. Two shotgun bolts is all you have. You see the rotate though, left side here. Don't worry about tanking. You're good. You got it. Right. Perfect. Box. You're good. Got a kill. Getting siphon. Get ready to play storm if you have to. It's okay to play storm. You have siphon. gone. Holy [ __ ] that kid beamed me. It's not a bad game, right? Eighth. As some bad.

world but if you can't hit your shots consistently for high damage all that is pretty much useless and that's why in today's video I'll be doing my updated guide on how to improve your aim fast in fortnite chapter 3 season 4. this video is going to include all of my favorite up-to-date practice methods you can use to improve your aim from all ranges and in all situations before we get into it

and without further Ado let's get into today's video so starting off this video I'm going to begin by going over three of my favorite creative maps that you can use to improve your aim these are going to be accessible to everybody they're all in creative and they should help you out a ton then after that towards the end of the video I'll actually be going over some tips for structuring your aim practice building a routine and things of that nature so with that said getting into our first practice method and we've got one of the most popular methods in the community which is aim duels specifically I'll be talking about Raiders 1v1 aim trainer this map is one of my favorite ways to practice your aim specifically because of how realistic it is if you're not familiar with aim duels aim tools are basically a map where you and your opponent are given a huge amount of HP usually like two thousand four thousand six thousand or something like that and then you're put into a situation where you're just shooting one another non-stop aim tools are super effective because they have you and a real player so you're shooting against the types of movements actual players make instead of a predictable Target and because they have so much variety this particular map has a ton of different scenarios as you can see on screen these range from close range shotgun flick scenarios to SMG spray scenarios and even scenarios where you're shooting an opponent out of the air who's gliding all these scenarios help you improve various forms of aim and they're pretty darn realistic another feature I love in this map is how you can get matched up with a random player just by hopping into the matchmaking portal so you don't have to sit there and find a person to aim to all against the game pretty much just provides that for you so overall Raiders 1v1 aim Trader is one of the best ways to improve your aim in fortnite and definitely something you should start using in your routine so with that said I'll put the code up on screen right now if you want to take note of it moving on to our second practice method though and next up we've got one of the ogm training maps in fortnite which is the scavic game trainer the scava game trainer is another aim training map which is absolutely amazing for pretty much all forms of aim much like Raiders map the scava game tuner has tons of scenarios ranging from close range with shotguns and SMGs to AR scenarios from mid-range and so much more the name skavic if you haven't noticed is literally Kovac spelled backwards and Kovacs is a super popular aim trainer outside of fortnite which people from tons of different games use scava game trainer was basically meant to be similar to Kovacs in the sense that it has a lot of the same scenarios except it's completely free and it's available and creative compared to Kovacs which cost money is outside of fortnite and is only accessible for PC players so in my opinion the scava game trainer is a super well-rounded aim trainer that pretty much everyone should be using and I strongly recommend you make use of it if you want to use this map then I'll put the code up on screen right now now moving on to our third map to improve your aim in fortnite and this one is probably going to surprise some of you and that's actually going to be Raider 464's mechanics training that V3 now I know you guys are probably wondering why on Earth would I use mechanics map to improve my aim but actually a lot of these scenarios and Raiders mechanics map can carry over super well to your aims specifically two of them and they also serve a special purpose because they're extra realistic because they involve both editing and building as well as aim for example the first section I really like for this purpose is the peace control X Peak training this section is pretty much a piece control section where your goal is to box up the Sentry and get a clean shot and if you Peak for too long the Sentry shoots you which means you have to be smart about the Peaks you go for the reason this works so well for your aim is because you're put into realistic situations where you're going for an optimal edit and you're practicing peaking from that specific edit so obviously it's much more specific to the types of edits you would actually do in real games this helps you improve the editing into shots and it helps to improve your aim so when you do peace control someone you're going to be better at aiming in that situation the other section I really like for improving your aim is actually going to be the Box fight training section in this section you've got a ton of bots that run around and shoot at you and your goal is basically to avoid taking damage and obviously eliminate them but much like the previous section we talked about this section can really help you with your aim because you're forced to edit into shots and get good Peaks although these two sections aren't specifically made for practicing your aim they do really help you improve your aim in a highly realistic environment which is exactly what might help a lot of you to become more consistent and carry over your aim practice into actual games since the situations involve building and editing this will help you really flow your edits and shots much better in actual games and should be super helpful and of course you do have the added benefit of improving your building and editing at the same time which certainly can't hurt so although the idea of using a mechanics map for aim training may seem a bit unusual this should help you guys quite a bit with that said I'll put the code up for this map on screen right now if you want to give it a shot so moving into the next section of this video and now that we've gone over all the top practice methods to improve your aim next up we're going to be getting into some general tips that I have for your aim training these are mainly going to be tidbits that I've picked up that I think can allow you to improve your aim faster and be more effective with your practice and starting off I want to discuss structuring your routine structuring your aim training routine is a pretty simple process but something that a lot of players mess up on when they're trying to improve their aim most players will hop into an amap once in a while and get some practice in but won't see much progress because there's no consistency in the actual way they practice so the first aspect of structuring your routine is going to come down to timing basically the goal here is to set the amount of time and when you're actually going to practice what I recommend you do here is to do your aim training routine when you first get on the game I tend to notice that when you're already in the game and getting some games then usually you won't want to stop in the middle of your session or take the time at the end to do a full aim training routine truthfully aim training isn't really going to be the most exciting thing so I tend to find it best for someone to get it done nice and early not to mention it conserved as a pretty solid warm-up to help you get your shots on point before you get into the game as well as that the second factor is how long you actually practice for now this is going to largely depend on the time you have to play for example if you're only on for two hours then doing a full hour of aim training isn't really going to make sense but if you play for 8 hours that one hour of practice may not be too crazy after all as a general rule I'd say to keep aim training to a maximum of 20 of your overall Time online so for every five hours you spend practicing you would do a maximum of one hour of aim training the other big factor here is skill level since it obviously takes a lot more time for an advanced player to improve compared to a beginner or intermediate player so for each time you get on I'd recommend that beginners spend about 20 minutes or less aim training intermediate players spend between in 20 and 45 minutes and advanced players spend at least 45 minutes the last aspect of structuring your routine is to actually select what you do but luckily you've already got three options from this video I recommend you mix in a bit of everything here and try to get at least two out of the three maps in this video and mix it up between close mid and long range as well as that if you have one particular weakness feel free to add extra time to specifically hone in on that weakness and improve on it for example if your shotgun name sucks then you may want to spend more time in closer in shotgun scenarios aim duels and things like that or if you can't hit your shots with an AR then you should try out some longer range tracking scenarios or even the glider scenario in Raiders 1v1 aim trainer overall though if you follow all these steps you should find yourself with a solid aim training routine specifically tailored to you which should help you improve your aim dramatically on to my final tip for this video though and that's the importance of consistency the biggest mistake that I find so many players making is being inconsistent with their aim training many players will aim train for a couple of days feel like they're not improving too much and then call it quits on AIM training entirely the biggest key here is to just stick with it and continue to aim train when you get on fortnite even if it gets kind of boring or you feel like you're not improving it on this process is going to take a lot of time but if you follow the steps in this video and you stay consistent with it you should find your aim improving dramatically but with all that said guys that's going to wrap it up for today's video on how to improve your aim fast in fortnite chapter 3 season 4 and future Seasons overall by following all the maps and advice in this video you should find yourself with a solid aim training routine that helps you to improve on a consistent basis if you found this video helpful then be sure to drop a like on it and consider subscribing as well if you want to see more content just like

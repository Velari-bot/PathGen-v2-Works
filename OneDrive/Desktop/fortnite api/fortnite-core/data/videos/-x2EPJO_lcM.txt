in this video I'm going to be covering how to warm up like polarized polarized dropped a 30 kill win in the last week's solo cash Cup finals that's 30 kills in the top 7,000 lobes of the whole region started as warm up with pgs pgs are ideal to start first because you can get your fingers and muscle memory warmed up in a low pressure environment where you don't have to worry about running out of mats or healing all right now that I'm loading into polarized map I'm going to PG but primarily I'm going to be practicing warming up my builds and edits and then I'll go into warming up my aim but right now I'm just going to focus on building and editing there's really no pressure here if I die I just respawn doesn't really mean anything all I want to do is get these edits warmed up for the cash cup since it doesn't really matter if I die I can just 50/50 work on my mechanics make sure I'm not playing slow it doesn't really matter if I win the PG or not all that really matters is that my fingers are getting warm my muscle memory is getting warm after this I'm going to be hopping into ranked to warm up my in-game mechanics and my in-game ping but right now all I'm focusing on doing is Spam editing trying to get some builds in just trying to get loose ready for the cash cup one thing I like to do is just go for Clips in these it's not because I necessarily need to hit a clip but because going for Clips helps me warm up my aim and my mechanics in the fastest way possible although I'm not necessarily trying to win I'll still be trying to block my opponent's shots it's not like I'm being complete pushover it's just not my main focus next he played a couple games of ranked ranked is an important part of a warm-up because the game feels totally different in a real match as opposed to creative and it's good to warm up with the new weapons that aren't in Creative as well as in-game delay and ping all right I'm in a rank game before I pushing to L I'm landing a little more lowkey this is spot I landed in Solo C cup so I'm familiar with it I know I can get Shield I know I can get guns I know I can get match before I push into lavish it's more important that you pick a spot that you're not going to die off spawn just because you want to get some fights in before you actually die so even if you don't win the game it's more important that you just don't die immediately cuz you don't want to waste your time in a Que oh my God didn't see that guy nice he left the match oh my God now I have all the medallions [Applause] nice although I won this game it's not super important to win the game more so that you just get a couple fights in either way it's time to hop into the last part of the warm up routine finally right before the cash cup he hopped into forever Zone Wars forever Z war is perfect warm up because it puts you in High Press endgame scenarios but instead of being penalized by having to wait when you die you spawn right back in map code will be at the top of the screen and in the description funnily enough as I was attempting to record this segment I was fumbling my words because this map is so high pressure as I was trying to talk about what made this map so great I was constantly getting pressured so hard that I couldn't even think about the words that I was saying this map has so much to think about and so much pressure that it's a direct simulation of endgame you have to keep track of Zone while you fight players while you try and keep track of your kill streaks while you try and not die while you try and get the 10 to win the game and drop a nuke this is the final thing that polariz did before he hopped into the cash cup and in the cash cup he actually dropped record kills about 50 in the three games of finals along with the 28 kill win solidifying this is one of the best warm-up routines thanks for watching hope you enjoyed no long outros bye

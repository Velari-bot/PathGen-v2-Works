we all know Poyo is one of the top fraggers on na but how come I never see any videos on him Peter Brock gets thousands of videos on him yet I see no recognition for his ex Duo poo that's why I made him part nine of my Pro analysis Series where I go in depth on how the top Pros do what they do and what you should replicate in your gameplay this is probably going to be the most in-depth Pro analysis that you'll see on poo since he's so underrated and when I say in-depth I mean I'm going to break down every little thing to make sure you guys improve in your next solo cash cup so without further Ado let's get into it all right guys so the first kill I want to show you guys here is actually how to abuse the shotgun meta if you guys don't know this Centennial pump does a lot of structure damage like insane basically breaks almost any new build in like less than 2 seconds if you know how to pressure right with your guns and I'll show you guys what that means right now so poo spots the opponent right here and starts tarping towards him and then as soon as he sees him try to edit out and get some peace inside the building he instantly shotgun replaces the cone that he just edited because the shotgun literally one shots it places a ramp to get some peace in gets the wall at the same time since the opponent didn't place the wall and as soon as he built that ramp the first thing he's doing is placing that wall just closing the this opponent in into that back wall that so now he can no longer get out of here since it's the building and what he does is he actually shoots the ramp since it does so much structure damage and then presses with his AR and the opponent literally can't do anything then the opponent takes out his shotgun so he does this nice Peak that I love that's these bottom four when the opponent's on the this would be the back right of the Box on his on the opponent's side you have to do this four tile edit where you can see the lower part of his body but he can't see almost any part of you and yeah just gets a free kill right here if you guys know how to pressure right with that shotgun and your AR just make sure you always have at least two shotgun shells so you don't run out of ammo but if you know how to pressure right with that shotgun you can get simple kills like this for this kill I want to show you guys what the perfect fight looks like in this season if you want to learn how to frag out consistently and get high kill games and what I mean by perfect is that every single thing poo does in this kill is exactly what you should replicate in your tournaments so he starts off with very good entry tags and that's what you need to do with this AR any AR works you just have to hit those shots it's a really broken AR then as soon as he teleports behind him which you should also usually do if you really want to apply pressure he starts shotgunning just to apply way more [Music] pressure just starts shooting his AR but when they realize that this opponent actually kind of knows what he's doing he starts building a little bit more but he still applies that same pressure at this angle he sets up an angle without even building he just finds a good angle that he can shoot from without being shot from and then starts applying pressure with his shotgun and AR at the same time just using almost all all of his bullets replaces everything and gets the back walls behind him to trap him and then just hits his shots and kills him and you can basically take a 50/50 after you get those entry tags if you just keep shooting your guns at them because they're never going to have time to heal this shotgun and AR combo if you're good at pressuring they're never going to have time to heal and you can just take a 50 because odds are you'll win if you just hit that last shot cuz they'll be like what 50 HP after a couple good shots from this AR and if you don't want to end up like this opponent you have to have a really good awareness for these ARS you probably shouldn't be just walking in the middle of the map like this guy is and yeah just keep an eye out cuz that AR will beam you and that can end your match in seconds all right boys so for this kill I want to show you guys How poo actually gets out of a very bad position so then when you get lasered in your next solo cash cup cuz it will happen I want to show you guys exactly what to do he gets lasered by the guy in front of him but then gets his kill stolen from this guy on the left hand side and what does is he instantly starts to heal and he goes towards the loot since he sees a bunch of mats on him and instantly switches to metal you can see he still has brick but he switches to metal when he knows he wants to heal and take his time inside a box and you will see how much mats poo actually expends into this fight for all of you people who don't build enough and want to quote unquote save your mats there's no such thing as saving your mats you should always be spending as much as you can to heal or as much as you have to because the end of the day you can just rearm and it's better to be shambles with zero mats than to die and all he's doing right now is just trying to get up to full HP since the opponent can't really pressure that quickly since he built the metal boxes so early and that's what he does perfectly right here if you're 1 HP you need to be using metal it's the easiest way to heal up just make a ton of metal boxes you can always just rearm or get the kill in front of you so he goes for height and you can see as soon as he go go for height he switches to Wood since these are temporary builds that he's placing he won't be boxed up in these so he builds in Wood then does some nice retakes goes for a lot of high walls but at the same time this is how you guys want to go for height I know a lot of you guys know how to high wall but you guys always go way too close when you highwall and if you go way too close when you high wall they can just jump through your wall sometimes so what he does is when when he High walls is he actually and he actually retakes backwards so I he can get another layer of elevation and just goes backwards without having the opponent Rush his face which is very very smart and then he gets these two day cones which gives him a good tag on the opponent the opponent now knows that he's fighting a very good player at least decent and he doesn't rush anything he's just looking for a good shot the opponent kind of knows what he's doing so he takes a penina butter and then just stays on height for a bit starts spraying him and then here is where he actually does another mistake he does two really bad wide edits which gets him shot very very hard right here you will see a lot of these pros make mistakes sometimes cuz they're used to getting kills so fast that sometimes they rush in a little too hard and when they actually end up fighting a decent or good player they get punished for it and he gets hit very very hard here down to 40 HP as soon as he gets that low guys he builds so many boxes okay so he tries he builds two boxes here but he realizes this is just not going to be enough he places the mid wall cuz he knows the opponent's going to try to get it and then just makes a bunch more boxes you're going to see how many mats he spends here and this is what you have to do when you really can't if you can't box up like two boxes and heal and the opponent keeps pressuring you need to move around a lot more you need to go up and down and this is what he does here he is the opponent he's building boxes but he's actually building them where the opponent's going to piece him instead of just boxing up behind and retreating it's a little bit of a offensive box just to get him off of him make him even more hard to hit and then he drops down cuz he knows this opponent is good and he will not be able to box up fully then switches to metal and goes back to the old metal box that he has if you guys have old builds when you're low you need to go back to those cuz that's going to be the best way to heal because those builds are already done if you keep making a bunch of new boxes without going to any old boxes or at least going up and down moving around you're just going to get you're just going to keep getting pressured until you run out of mats or make a bad edit and you could see and I know a lot of you guys want to go for counter Peaks but that's usually how you can end up dying if you go for too many counter Peaks and I am a victim of this when I'm fighting in solos I go for way too many counter Peaks when I'm low and that gets me killed even though they're good Peaks sometimes I mess up and make one bad Peak and that can end your game and what poo does is he doesn't even look at the opponent once after he gets hit hard he just makes a bunch of boxes and tries to get him to run around as much as he can and heals and that's how he gets the upper hand now not fully yet but you'll see he just keeps moving around keeps either going up and down now he's going down and just keeps trying to get that heal off making as much distance he knows he can't go to the right so he goes what he actually does that his very very smart is since he knows he can't make a lot of more boxes cuz he doesn't have a lot of space he actually goes back into the old builds that are already more healthy and which is very very smart and now he has so much space to work with so much uh so many full builds are full HP especially metal it's just no matter how good you are as a player this guy right here the blue superhero is pretty good no matter how good you are if you Retreat back into Old boxes that are fully built like he did right there he will not be able to pressure you at all and almost 90% of the time you'll be able to get some heals off and then the opponent gets a little too greedy he gets very impatient which will happen when you run around a lot like this and now poo is basically just able to relax because he spent so many mats on doing that now all he has to do is either run away or try to kill him with the little mats that he has 92 builds is enough to get a quick kill if you're good enough and hit your shots but if I if this was me I would just run away get some mats and look for a refresh later on and the kill doesn't really matter here since I was just showing you guys how to fight defensively but yeah the opponent gets impatient again walks into his box and gets a very free head shot on him and I actually find this kill pretty funny since the opponent was really good at pressuring but actually just doesn't know how to fight the defensively at all when poo is actually fighting him yeah you guys want to make sure you're good at both so you don't end up like this guy before we get into the next kill if you enjoy the videos and you want to support the channel even more consider using Code wrath FN in the item shop and yeah that's it so for this next I want to show you guys how to counter people just holding out guns and are trying to get inside your face here we have an opponent that got P you a little bit low and he gets very aggressive poo does an insta edit but he misses and he just tries to get out then I'm pretty sure when he goes up here the opponent tries to get in his face yeah he's instantly in his face and then poo actually gets hit hard here and misses or he does hit a shot but very small but now the opponent is fully in Poo's box and this why you never want to get inside people's faces cuz if they manag to get out you're pretty much done and this is how to counter people holding out guns poo takes a very nice Peak here peanut butter but the opponent knows how to counter by going fully to the right and then the opponent is just sitting here obviously with this gun out and what you have to do is you have to take several different angles if you want to beat this strategy of holding out your gun he goes for the top angle he misses then he drops down goes on the side gets a nice shot there cuz he held it he's not exactly predictable with his edits when he's piing taking that Peak and then he goes up just holds the wall sits on the top takes another Peak and then he switches back and then kills him you guys think that may be a simple kill but I know a lot of you can die in this situation cuz you will take bad Peaks just cuz they're fully boxed doesn't mean they don't have a gun guys so you have to take a lot of different angles if you want to beat them when they're holding out gun A lot of these kills you guys are going to realize it doesn't take a lot of mechanical skill you just have to learn the right plays in the right scenario and here po displays how to apply a good pressure with your guns since it is meta this season he spots an opponent gets a first shot off and the opponent runs inside the building and the first thing he does is he pieces and he notices that there's nothing in his box and that he can't go anywhere so this wall is extremely important to get the in the very first couple seconds he needs to get it fast so what he does is he shotguns the wall gets it low pickaxes takes the wall and places a cone at at the same time which you can do on any single ping it does not matter you just have to press both at the same time and he actually traps the opponent since the opponent was in the middle he traps the opponent in a cone and from there on he just has to do a good edit and it's a free kill I know almost 90% of you can do this you just have to know the right scenario if your opponent's backed into a wall like this you need to get this wall in front that's the most important thing what I would do instead is I would place a ramp instead of the cuz they don't always end up inside the cone and they can't get a shot on you or try to take the wall if they end up on top of your cone what I like to do is place a ramp to block them off and then if they go out the right or the left here then I can just pre-b box that and it's a free kill but either way it's a easy kill all right so that is going to end the video for today guys for all the real ones that stay to the end comment underrated and all you boys that come to my stream I am going to start streaming very very soon again probably going to stream

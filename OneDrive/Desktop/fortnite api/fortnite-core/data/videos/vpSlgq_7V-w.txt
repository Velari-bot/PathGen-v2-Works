in today's video we're taking a look at how to W key in Solo cash cups in chapter four looking at pixie actually of course he's absolutely unbelievable so this is his third cash cup win an average of six elims which is the games we're looking at here just a lot of mid game fights a lot of really smart fundamental things that he's doing very well at the lows a whole lot of tips and tricks you guys can go ahead and learn from I'll go ahead and Link pixie's YouTube video if you guys want to watch his endgame so you've got three wins which is really impressive and I'm also going to be having a masterclass update with Pixie coming out very soon or at the time of upload if you go to the Solo's Mask cast make sure to go and check that out down below in the description as well all right let's go straight into this with one of the biggest things I think you guys are probably lacking with your solo fighting a lot of people don't know you can actually cancel so many of your animations in games such as pickaxing and such as reloading by pulling out builds you can see here he gets caught with his pickaxe out hops down to the one the guy instant edits however he's ready for this so before the guy can even get his shotgun out he's actually scanned the Box realize the guy's actually lacking this middle wall here and the centerpiece in his direct box there's a code in this box but not in the one he's actually in so he's ready for this he immediately gets a stare into the guy's face the guy shoots into the ramp and take a look at how good his edit is here in terms of how much little motion there is wasted you can see he doesn't edit and he finishes here so he's got very easy flick on 10 shot level a lot of you guys are over editing you're over flicking you're doing too much edits are really simple you're gonna need to get in the habit of doing an edit in the most efficient way possible so your Crosshair doesn't have to go as far to hit a perfect Max damage headshot straight after like he always does whenever you go ahead and do a war place in fortnite you guys always need to do this which is to place a cone at the same time or before you actually place the wall there's actually a delay where you can't place a wall or the same build in the same spot directly after each other in the same server tick which is why sometimes you get sprayed for your water I'm sure you guys experience that but it also means that you can actually 100 of the time phaser currently through someone's box no matter what your opinions of course you're not always guaranteed to get the wall after in this case Pixies from Sweden actually got the wall because the other guy was getting healed off and he gets the cone off at the same time which is what he normally tries to do and he's able to get a very simple kill mid game with that technique one thing that picks it does absolutely every single time you take so either an early or a mid game fight is he tries to create a damage advantage to start it he does this by sneaking around like in his first clip and also this later clip he just hides behind things a lot of the time to catch people off guard you never want to start a fight or your turns HP and your enemies to engine HP instead position yourself well do things like he's doing here just waiting and being patient and it's gonna allow you to get free pumps 300 pegs in the side and then you can WP and pressure the person and you're on the offensive in that scenario one of the biggest things I think you guys should take away from pixie about how to be good at w King in chapter four is to pressure from multiple different sites take a look at how many things he approaches from here he's smacking on the top then the ability drops down to the wall on the side he's always making sure he's not double pickaxing directly and the guy's always trying to like either SMG or shotgun it as he drops onto it there's a couple of these little drop down plays right here now he gets a free shot off because again he swapped his angle he's very good at approaching two by ones and dealing with players with a lock box that's built as you can see this guy's doing and whenever you pressure people from loads of different sides like this you make it very awkward for them to keep track of what is theirs and what is it she actually ends up happening here the guy runs down to some builds they're actually Pixies he's able to pressure from this side and as soon as you pressure a box that is the guy's obviously gonna make a two Bond so he swaps from going from the short side where the guys actually got two whole things defending him and he swaps to going from his long side which is what I recommend you guys do goes to this alongside the guy tries to learn it good moving to get out of the way of that then he phases in the stair just here and just take a look at this perfect drop down play full box is the guy and hits the max at the same time lovely stuff the number one fortnite skill that you guys like is going to be your defensive fighting I know you guys can W Keen Arena and tournaments especially your first game you can do well but how good are you when you get hit for 100 from behind and there's someone pressuring you I guarantee you guys have died in a Solo cash cup just like this take a look what pixie does he goes ahead and immediately makes a two by one and immediately immediately looks for counter damage because this nice timing shot on the guys he's pressuring him that timing shot allows him to get one heal off and only one heel and again as soon as he's got this one mini off he immediately looks for more counter damage on the guy now the other guy's forced into actually going ahead and healing up at the same time which is what pixie does very smartly here he goes ahead and heals up and then in that instant about five seconds there of him actually count the peaking now he's on the offensive he can set up this smart trick where he phases straight into the box from behind the stair like this very unexpected for this guy pops into the box and hits a Max lovely stuff this is probably the most broken edits that you can do in fortnite this guy approaches the boxes pickaxe out pixie hears the audio cubes the Icebreaker come out right there so he gets a free timing shot off and now he's able to jump down and get the full box on that guy at this point in time a lot of you players watching this would go ahead and do an open edit and try to actually out trade the guy however in the situation he's got a worse shotgun and he's obviously going to do less damage to the opponent it's already only 150 HP so take a look at the settings That's goes in there's a whole tile edit right here and it is impossible to get hit by the player up on the ramp in this scenario make sure you don't have a code in your box since otherwise your head will be peeking over but as you can see the guy can only see the top of pixie's head which is very hard to hit and if he does try to hit it he's actually going to pump the ball and break the wall and make it even easier for pixie to hit him in return so you can see pixie is a 300 tag right there and then he swaps into it very smart at it again it's a right hand window sprays through the wall as the guy tries to damage and return and take snap very quickly so this next site is honestly one of the best examples I've ever seen in terms of tracking your opponent while you're fighting them and a lot of people especially at sort of lower level or people that aren't consistently sort of qualifying for Cash Card finals do this really badly as you can see here he takes this damage show the other guy misses his shot however if he does pump pixie it's fine it's got a splashes to heal up for this mid game fight and he goes ahead and pressures it and take a look at his Crosshair I'll go ahead and put like a circle thing in the screen here the enemy is always within this circle right at no point in this whole sort of fight here is Pixie looking away while he's placing builds like even right here he turns back he's straight onto the guys well as he sprang through take a look at this or slows down he's spraying directly at the guy so he can try to get bleed through damage as he goes ahead and tries to get to all replacing the cone again he gets very unlucky to not hit this shot as the guy sort of moves out the way of it he's always tracking even when he's reloading even when he's going ahead and pressuring him from a different angle he's keeping his cross set Dead locked on the guy and the reason this is so effective is of course it's much easier to aim you're not flicking on a wider angle he obviously plays a lower sense so it's actually really useful to make sure you're consistent with your shots if you're playing a lower sense and when it comes to just out trading someone you've got to remember whenever someone edits on you I'm sure you guys have this happen to cash cup where you fight someone and they're just instead it the whole time and it always catches you off guard however if you're ready with your shotgun out like it's here in a second he's always aiming even when he's reloading even when he should be sort of placing a build or something or he should maybe go ahead and pressing them right now he's always just looking at the opponent and he forces to go into making a mistake that guy's moving his Crosshair off pixie means he's not tracking him allows pixie to get that shot off and close the fight out and also just quickly he's W King for Hamlet viewers I'm wondering why he's taking this mid-game fight here it might seem a little bit random but in his cash Club finals if you're a good fighter you need to be fighting for a hammer every single game

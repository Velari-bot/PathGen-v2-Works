so you want to learn claw and build like this you have come to the right video I have been playing Cloud for over 100 days and I will explain how you can learn claw as fast as possible to learn Claude there are three important steps to take settings hand placement and practice with these three steps you can learn claw very fast these are my right hand claw settings so if you don't have Cloud binds you can copy my settings they are perfect for cloud players so to get started with claw first thing you're gonna have to do is just hold your controller normally and take your index finger and put it over these buttons right here so now as you can see we're going to be pressing our triggers with our middle finger you never press your triggers with your index finger again your index finger only touches the front buttons If you take a close look at both of my hands you can see that my right hand sits on my controller a little different it's because that is what's comfortable for me I don't know what's comfortable for you guys but you need to find your comfortable position on your own if you start feeling any pain or discomfort just take a break and stretch out your hands because you don't want to get an injury or anything serious like that me personally I don't have any pain because I've been playing Cloud for so long a lot of people ask me why I edit with Triangle Well it's because my index finger rests on my triangle naturally so it feels comfortable for me so as you can see it's just easy for me to press triangle you really need to get comfortable pressing these four buttons right here which are index fingers so just take your time and get comfortable pressing these buttons so now that we understand how claw Works what I want you to do is just get used to the hand placement of your palm so just get comfortable you know do some 90s go play some games build just slowly get used to it it's not gonna happen fast but with time you will get comfortable and this will feel natural to you it just takes some practice and patience with time you will be even better and trust me in a couple of days it will be worth it it's not going to take long for you to get comfortable on claw so to improve on claw and get even better you need to play this map it has so many edits and so many opportunities for you to like get comfortable and just improve and edit faster as well so go into this map try it out there's so many edits you can just spend hours in here I used to play this map a lot and that's how I became kind of fast and kind of good at the game and we also have Raiders Beast control map this is a good map to get used to claw you can come here work on your Beast control do some builds do some edits and in my opinion if you play both of these Maps you will get comfortable in no time there really is no secret to learning claw it just takes time and it's all about practice and how much work you put in in my opinion it's not that hard and it's actually very easy for me it didn't take long so if you want to learn Clon now is the perfect time trust me with time you will get it down and you will be way better than you were before I wanted to thank you guys for all the support I really see your comments and we're at 12 000 subscribers and just thank you if you have any questions or anything regarding the video leave a comment down below I will try to answer as many comments as I can and yeah thank you for watching if this video helped you leave a like subscribe and comment down below and I will see you guys next time

today I'm just going to be showing you guys pretty much a breakdown on how to make your first earnings in fortnite you know there's tons of ways to do this obviously the one I'm going to be looking at today is definitely the solo Victory cash Cup finals you know these are probably the best and easiest way for casual players and pro players to just make earnings you know you're able to queue up every single time they go live the first Open qualifier I believe is top 7500 to qualify and once you do that you go into to the second round where all you have to do is win a game and you can make money so what better video to show you guys than actually a world record 41 kill win I would show you guys a win of my own or some gameplay but uh unfortunately I haven't made it around to the solo Victory cash cups this season but yeah we're just going to be watching a Peter bot vid and uh we're going to break this down and kind of just analyze it and see what he does in order to make his earnings uh maybe a lot different than what some of you guys will do but uh we'll jump into that we can see that Peter decides to land Grim Gates so Grim gate is actually one of the best pois in the game right now maybe of all time all right looking over at Grim gate you can see that it has 1 2 3 four five and six God chests and that is just alone God chest that pretty much spawn every single game well they do spawn every game they're 100% uh chest rate the rest of the POI has a lot of chest as well gold highlighted ones are ones that spawn 100% of the time which I actually just just found out the chests are great here um and The Medallion that you get is actually the dash Medallion and you also get one of the best shotguns in the game right now you get the Mythic shotgun you guys will see some gameplay here from Peter bot of him using it and uh you know I would suggest for you know higher level players to probably land here just because the reward is so high and once you get into the finals aren't too many players that try to go for it and the ones that do are kind of just trying to get in and out they're just trying to play a game hopefully luckily get a win and then after that they're just hopping off there are a lot of other drop spots that you guys can definitely land at if you just want to play it a lot safer you don't need to go for The Medallion right away there's definitely tons of strategies in order for you to win a game without The Medallion all right so we're seeing Peter hold a DMR and the shotgun uh the reason for this is probably just because he can start off a lot of fights with huge tags like he just did he hit that guy 114 I believe it was and and and he just dashed into his box afterwards and killed him he gets the early damage over aggresses so they can't heal and then he just you know keeps going from there the way that you know Peter plays these he plays very overaggressive uh just in order to get fights over with just so he can drop a kill record obviously but I mean this is just a great way in general to fight in a lot of these situations you're going to see people run because these guys are trying to get their first earnings as well Peter's just running at them um but I mean I think right right now in fortnite this is definitely the best time for anybody to make earnings so in a lot of these scenarios you're just going to seem going for full Clips um I mean he's just trying to end fights honestly Peter's mechanics are pretty insane so a lot of the things you're watching here you're not going to instantly be able to implement your game play but you can definitely pick up and you know just notice small things like right there how instead of just running into the wall after he hit him hard he put a wall in between cuz he knew the guy would try to counter damage just small things like that you can always learn from watching people who are really good at fighting there's you can learn from every single situation in fortnite see a lot of these guys are opening an edit uh Peter has Dash coin so he's instantly running at it taking it with a purple SMG and then he's just you know insta killing them with a shotgun it's pretty much a twap now some of you may be thinking like okay if Peter's in my game what can I do to avoid a player like this and uh the best thing I would probably say is just to get away from the green part of the map the whole early to mid game process is just if you're not going to be fighting it's just all going to be about setting yourself up for the end game putting yourself in the best position to do that and uh yeah so it's just going to be making sure you have metal cuz brick and wood are pretty easy to find on this map brick especially you pretty much can find in any POI any area of the map um so having brick or having wood and metal are you know very important you know a lot of people wonder what your Loadout should be in the solo vict ictory cups and right here peterb pretty much has the prime load out you're going to want to have medkits you're going to want to have some sort of heal uh being like a shield and then you're going to want to have floppers uh because those he almost died there but the uh floppers cancel out um the storm sickness at the end of the game so once you're getting hit by it you can actually out heal it with the floppers so that's why everybody keeps them and the only issue here in this situation is is Fizz is a slow heal so he's not able to instantly heal he has to play his metal boxes and hold right there he only got five off where instead if he had like a mini or something else he would have got a few more so this is where you need to be really good at counter damaging a lot of players are just going to fold right here they get hit 100 and it's done pretty much Peter right here he's doing something he doesn't need to do he's taking storm damage uh every little tick in these games matters so much tanking zone is not something you want to do because if the player you're going against in the final 1 V one took zero Zone damage and you took a lot then you are going to uh lose the heal off when you're playing medkits at the end so going into end games I think it's pretty important to usually have above a th000 mats I don't really have a set amount of materials for when I need to go for a refresh so say I look down at my materials and I have like 500 I don't instantly think like okay once I go down to 250 mats I need to look for a refresh I think it's just while my materials are dwindling down over the end game you're just actively thinking of where can I get the next refresh obviously there's scenarios where you're going into the first moving with you know 200 mats and you instantly need a kill so I guess you could say around you know 500 mats or less going into a first moving Zone you're going to need to find a refresh within that first Zone I mean this is this is the half half here everyone's going up a hill they're just dying Peter's tanking a lot of Zone damage but you know because he's killing the entire Lobby it's probably not even going to go to heal off yeah so right here you can see he has 1,300 materials total going into the end game I mean he doesn't need to fight here obviously but he's just doing it just cuz and uh you see on first moving he goes up to isolate this guy on height to fight him um you know dashcoin allows you to do things like this solos uh you know dead side is always just going to be very important um learning how to conserve m really well is super important as well uh just trying to put yourself in situations where you're not just burning mats um you know being on backside Zone having a guy look at you like this guy is and you know he's losing everything because of it Max Ms I mean he's not Dy of materials he has the best coin the shotgun is amazing so if you guys ever find yourself in these positions you could play like this or you could uh you know you you could play a little safer with this load out and kind of just guarantee the wins um going for height is really good with a medallion and usually if you don't have a medallion uh you know you could play lower layers it's honestly it's all preference I don't think there's any position in the game that is at a disadvantage I think low ground's good in its own ways I think midg ground has its advantages I think height is really good in its own ways it's just all a matter of when you do it or when you're going for them and at this point in my career I pretty much played every single layer I've tested everything out uh you know very strictly like I played where I only go low ground at times I played where I only go height at times I played where I only do mid ground and that's probably the best advice I could give uh you know they're all good in their own way so don't think any is are better than the others and uh certain metas cater towards certain layers being better and uh know it's just about knowing when that is be a little nervous right here this is for 41 I mean he is the best l in the game it's pretty much un losable there it is man pretty much a good summary of uh this video and how to make your first earnings um you know always remember just play Confident uh know you're never going to do anything in these games by being scared or having the most passive mindset it's just not going to happen you're going to run into people who are more confident than you who are going to out aim you who are going to outsmart you there people that are going to do everything so you need to find confidence in your ability abilities and uh you know at the end of the day I know a lot of people get nervous because they take it so serious but you really got to find the enjoyment out of games like these and just try to have fun while you're doing it like the best way to eliminate nerves is to just obviously back it with confidence cuz when you're confident you're less nervous and uh you know just have fun and remember there's always going to be another game that you can queue into um and uh try to play with just the learning mindset rather than the mindset of oh my gosh I need to make my earnings in this game I need to win this tournament you know try to think of it more so as okay this is a tournament I'm going to play it I'm going to learn whatever happens however it goes I'm going to learn things out of this and that's probably the best way you are going to improve in this game that's going to be the end of the video I hope you guys did enjoy I know it was a little bit sloppy the way I was kind of explaining things obviously cuz I was watching a Peter B vid and he was just dropping a bunch of kills and then I was telling you guys to play more passive in certain situations so I think I could probably do a better in-depth video in the future this was just a very general just speak over you know the best way to make your first earnings yeah guys hope you did enjoy please make sure to leave a like comment and subscribe yeah thank you guys

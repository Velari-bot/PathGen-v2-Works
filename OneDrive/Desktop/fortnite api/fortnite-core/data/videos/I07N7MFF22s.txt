petbot is the best player in the world at the moment by an absolute country mile he's got some of the fastest mechanics we've ever seen in fortnite the best aim and the game at the moment as well as he tends to just read people's minds and takes out Pros with ease every single fight now even the best Pros can't even compete with a single aspect of PE bot's game but there is one thing that any player watching this video can do and that is copy his game plan and this is the exact same game plan and structure that he used every single solo game no matter if he's solo clutching during the global championships or he's just playing a cash cup and trying to drop a 30 bomb he does the exact same plays every single game and I'm going to show you guys in as much detail as possible how you can play like him in solos the petb drop spot he of course Landing a brutal box cards right here and the key thing that he's aiming for is this northand side however this game he gets contested on the North and very crucially he spots this somebody down here to the South so rather risking having a long drawn out fight where he maybe lands at this building and then pushes over towards the opponent when there a third party n instead he just goes ahead and straight up 50/50s and this is one big thing if you go outd drop somebody always try to just contest the floors one they're going for so you can get the fight done as quick as possible the opponent does a good play which is landing up here in the bush but P does a better play which is landing early and then sliding towards the floor spawn so you can get there first and he's able to win this 50/50 get himself a little bit of mats and go ahead and very quickly loot up and the main reason he's landing on this northand side is is a lot quicker to loot up compared to the South as well as the fights don't take quite as long it allows him to hop straight onto the train so the train is going to go ahead and rotate through here every single game it's the exact same thing in trios as well and then all he needs to do is open the train gets loads of metal from that as well as the extra four chests that spawn in the train itself and he do a couple nice things as he loots up as he goes ahead and grabs extra blobs and by the time that he opens this chest he's ended up in this metal area where we can get cat metal so now by the time he opens up this train chest he's able to get loads of metal from this a Mythic AR which is obviously super nice and he's going to immediately make a beine for a shrine nearby and shrines you guys haven't watched my last video are so important for Sol success the season I'd really recommend you guys within the first 2 minutes of the game prioritize getting a shrine and the way petb does that is just Farms up wooden brick on the way and then he's going to be in a really good map position in case he gets contested on the shrine now just because peterb is a really good fight it doesn't mean that he doesn't focus on Zone positioning and he does a really good job of it this game as you can see right here from this Zone pole is pulling down to the South there's loads of water in the bottom South there's lots of area down here where Zone's likely to pull into exactly what happens this game so he prioritizes getting deep on the south side of Zone as early as possible so then the first 5 minutes of the game he's already making his way down to where the later Zone going to be pulling which allows him to have a really easy time mid game if you guys suck at solos it's probably because you will being too slow off spawn like all these other players and you're going to end up on congested side of the entire game wasting all your Shield wasting all your M and having a very difficult time of rotating as pbot is able to rotate and maintain cap mats the entire way through as well as this insanely good Loadout which he's going to use here in a second to get into some fights now when it comes to these fights I've already done loads of videos breaking down pet fights but there's three things that he does very very well when it comes to fighting in these stacked top 600 games where the average skill is so much higher the people he's King are actually pretty good players with earnings the first thing that he does is reload management and then the next thing is just Crosshair tracking so whenever somebody does you know a mistake in a fight if your crosshairs on them you're able to punish them for that mistake straight away so as you can see see this guy went ahead and accidentally pumped that build trying to catch P off P blocked it he's immediately able to get the 100 tag in return and then really simply just crossair track the enemy make sure you're always spraying and breaking the builds that they're actually in and you're not letting them run away so rather than getting caught out in a situation like this because P bot's crosso tracking them he knows exactly where the guy is he gets underneath and again just like I was saying reload management is genuinely so important this season cuz right here petbot makes a mistaken edits if you take a look he has no shotgun bullets so he needs to reload other guys still has shotgun bullets and he's decently healthy as as well he could easily lose this fight if he does a bad edit right here instead he lets the opponent get shotgun DeLay So shotgun lock himself then he goes ahead and edits after he's reloaded and gets a very free kill on a very good player right there Then in his next fight P does another few things absolutely perfectly as you can see right here this is a really common mistake that people do in fights is they get straight on a wall to- wall situation and start pickaxing which is something you should really try to avoid cuz if you were to just pickaxe on this straight wall the guy could into a window Peak a top right Peak and get shot on you straight away so what P does is he approaches the weak wall where the guy is going to have to do an edit from a left hand Peak so he goes to his right which means it's to the enemy's left so he swings and now when the guys goes to do an edit as you can see petbot already got his pickaxe out and ready he's able to take that wall and exact same as earlier he has the reload management so when he gets in the Box he's not out of bullets and he's not wasted his bullets beforehand and he's able to get a nice free kill and get himself stacked for the end game as you can see right here and when it comes to these partial zones PB follows the exact same plan every single game and the first step of that plan is just get a little bit of info before you go he doesn't always go instantaneously as soon as Zone pops he Scouts for a second he looks what other people nearby are doing and then he tries to go pretty early so within around 10 seconds of the Zone swapping this is so important so you're not getting caught up on the back side like all these other people are instead he's now in a really easy position he's able to have a lot of visibility from this Center Spot he doesn't just stop though at this point I think it's really important instead he keeps on going early which is genuinely so so crucial for how he plays this game out so as you can see he goes nice and early he tanks a couple ticks getting into the end zone but as you can see from the zone right here he is literally the first player into the current Zone every single time and this is so important for his success in solos and basically every mode as well cuz you know the best Duos and the trios player in the world at the moment and the main reason he does this guys is to get refreshes and to get loot even though right here you might be thinking oh he's pretty good on mats he maybe needs a siphon kill he always is trying to get kills and set himself up to be the most stacked player in the lobby and how does he do this by being the first one into the Ender Zone and the first one looking back for kills and a big misconception of refreshes is that it needs to be you box fighting and killing somebody but a lot of the time refreshes just come from being the first one into Zone and then spotting somebody who dies as they do a bad rotate like that other player you see that guy got killed on the rotate pbot straight away goes over claims all of the loot and now he gets a nice little refresh he gets an extra big for himself to heal himself up a little bit and he's in a really good position now when it comes to moving zones peterb keeps it the exact same every single game and the main reason for doing this is it makes it really simple to follow and not make mistakes each time the first thing that he does on moving zones is he splits The Zone up into two rotates so rather than just doing one long rotate or doing a bunch of little mini rotates he does two sort of medium distance rotates involving the TP mask the only mask of course the first thing that he tries to do is go on the edge of Zone and not go too far with his only mask he's not just throwing like a max distance one up in the air he's going to get beam behind he has a little mini rotate and the main reason he's going to the edge right here is now there's nobody behind him there's nobody really in front of him because of course the Zone's expanding up this way and it allows P to not take any storm ticks unnecessarily as well as it allows him to have a really easy time of doing his next rotate which is really really crucial this next one is the most important one so the first one is just a nice little mini rotate into the edge of zone so now he's got a very easy time of being the first one or one of the first people into the end of moving zone so let's watch how he does it he does a nice little high TP pops it before it goes too high in the sky so he doesn't take any damage and immediately gets himself into the end of zone right here and let me just pause the zone for a second if you guys take a look as you can see he is one of maybe five people that's in the end of zone right here as you can see he's in the end zone he's boxed up and the Really crucial thing with this is there's about 20 other people in the game who are either next to him or about to rotate through him on this congested side of Zone all of these players are going to run straight past Peter's box and he's going to have a very very easy time of getting refreshes from this position exactly like you see right here as well as the key thing of being the first one into the end of moving Zone guys is you have so much time to look for a kill he has like 20 plus seconds maybe 25 seconds including the next zone so look for a kill which is really really crucial so you're not just spending 5 Seconds looking for a kill when you rotate late instead you're spending 20 plus seconds every game every moving Zone looking for a kill and he's able to do that he ctures somebody unaware that the wall is low he's able to spray through get the replac when the guy is not looking and he gets a very free kill right here and the key thing as soon as he gets this kill is he Scouts for a second and thenm just claims all the loot and waste materials getting onto the loot right here and this is when he does a very very nice play for second moving I break down in the second now of course the main issue when you do plays like this and you get refreshes and the first moving especially when you're the first one into zone is you tend to have pretty bad Zone positioning if I zoom in right here and play it for a second as you can see everybody else is deeper into Zone which is actually really good if you're super St to mats you should try to be deep Zone because now as second moving pulls no matter where second moving pulls you have an easy time of rotating if you're much deeper on Zone like all these other players up here on the North side up as you can see Zone PS far which for Peter bot because he's backside he was getting refreshes even though he got the refresh and he got stacked off it he's in a pretty bad spot to do this rotate and this is when he does another really really smart thing he tries to do a quick little TP rotate from backside he realizes this is way too scuffed way too congested everybody's blocking him so what does he do he runs back into storm and uses some of those whites that he got from the play that he just killed and actually gets himself a really easy rotate to do and this is one thing I'd recommend if you guys ever in a tough spot to do a rotate and you've got mask just tank storm backside if you've got whites and then go ahead and do a really easy rotate just like this pbot doeses and the key thing you'll notice again with this rotate is he is sticking to his edge of Zone like this rough giggly going up here like these other players instead of being in the center right here like the snowy James instead he's actually on the edge of Zone which makes it really easy to do his next rotate that he's going to do and this is one thing that I think everybody watching this needs to learn is you don't always need to use Mobility to rotate you can just do a little Sprint rotate right here he spots a perfect timing nobody's looking at him he s middle of Zone he's on the edge nobody's really looking at him and he's able to do an absolutely perfect rotate he uses wood to you know build the partial rotate and then he swaps the brick as he comes into the end of Zone and now this is a really really important thing you shouldn't always be getting refreshes at the end of Zone because then you become very predictable you don't catch people off guard cuz they're probably expecting it as often instead what petot does here is he looks for refreshes midm moving zone for a period of time as you can see he looks for refreshes he ends up getting this guy killed right here but he doesn't risk going for that luk since it's not really safe to do that instead what he does is just prioritizes having a good rotate and being one of the first people into the end of Zone and exactly like I just said where if you really stack on mat you want to be deeper on Zone look what peterb does he goes as deep as possible even tanks a couple ticks front side right here to be the deepest one in zone and also again very similar to earlier he's one of the first people into this moving Zone he's not boxed up on congested side right here like all these other players instead he's way deeper on this Zone which is going to mean that he's got way easier time of doing the next part of this game which I want to talk about in a second now at this point pbot has around a 10sec window where he can look for a kill before Zone start kicking him out which is actually really important the reason why he went very deep towards Center of zone right here is rather than being boxed right here and only having maybe 5 Seconds to look for a kill before Zone kicks out he's got a longer period of time to look for that kill exactly what he does and exactly like earlier guys the number one way I'd recommend going for a refresh is awareness checks so even when somebody's not looking in their wall and their wall is low HP you can take it very quickly or the most common and probably the best method the method that pet used to get the most Refreshers in this cup I think more than half of his kills came from this exact same method is awareness checks on somebody's flaws as you can see this fortnite goat right here is distracted he's looking for kills on his wall and what does petbot do take a look at this out gets the stairing he gets the floor edited in as well and it's nothing to do with ping nothing to do with anything like that it's literally just awareness this guy wasn't looking at his feet and that meant petbot was able to take it and hit 100 right here but if you pay attention just quickly what does petbot not do in this situation he does not get greedy going for this kill cuz none of these edits are his it might be very risky he might you know this guy could be doing a nice Peak over here and even though this guy's one HP is still not a good play to run into this box chasing that kill especially if you guys are paying attention right now there is a new Zone Zone has just swapped The Zone Clon has gone off which in petbot mind tells him that he needs to immediately rotate and he does a really really nice play right here that I want to break down for you guys and I'd really recommend you guys do this play every single time as soon as Zone swaps he gets a little bit of info just has a look that there's nobody looking at him right here and he does a nice Simple Wood rotate gets up a layer so he's not on the same layer as this guy and goes ahead and does this really really common Play and play I'd really recommend you guys learn is the tast and box so a tast and box is basically a 2x1 but instead of having you know cones and things everywhere you just have a St blocking your back to save materials and also you've got no cones on top so you can actually look up easier and the key thing that he does is as soon as he does this tasing box as he looks up through the stair at it he holds the stair at it looks up spots there's nobody up on height and what do you know fortnite goat returns right here and this is a really important lesson for you guys just cuz you hit somebody 100 during the end game and you maybe want to get the kill doesn't mean you should commit for the kill what tends to happen if you rotate front side and get yourself in a good position after you hit somebody low you're going to find another kill either you that play is going to run into you because they're healing up backside all what's going to happen is the person that kills that player is going to run into you and you're going to get double refresh more often than not and right here what does he run into the fortnite goat he's able to take the wall does a shotgun replace right there of course he's got good reload management then he do a very nice play which is the scroll wheel reset so now fortnite goat has got the little delay on his shotgun he's not quite ready for it and then petbot finishes the fight with a nice simple R and Peak takes a little bit of damage but this is the main reason why that t box is so crucial is whenever you're back here fighting for a kill on this back stair like he was just there you have a whole extra box where time which is so important end game timings and end game are the most important thing which brings me on to my next point which is really really really important for winning games this season guys now at this point in the video I want everybody watching this if you watch this on the day that I released the video or 2 months from now or whenever you watch this video I want you to write down in the comments what Peter bot should do next so let's just take a look at his situation he's got back to 200 hp he's got you know pretty good ammo not really that important but he's got enough ammo for what he's going to do next as well as he has got loads of materials from that single refresh that he just got as well as that refresh that he got on first moving what should petbot do next guys and this is really really important I've been making videos explaining this exact same concept for like 4 years now ever since I made the solo masterclass it's genuinely so important you learn what to do next because it's going to be the difference when you getting you know top five maybe if you have a good game compared to winning every single game on repeat and potentially making earnings and hopefully you've written it down in the comments by now because it is super obvious to me and so whenever I was doing this live and watching it on stream that he should take kite and the main reason he should take kite is he has mat advantage on both these other players on Scrabble right here who's having a little bit of a difficult time on storm right here who's got 17 builds he has more mats than both of the other players up on height all he needs to do is get above these other players and he's got a really easy time of winning the game let me go watch another game example where pet follows the exact same game plan structure for early mid end game but he does a different height take that I want you guys to learn cuz the different height take that he does is a lot more of a common situation that you're going to find yourself in really really important guys as soon as you get a refresh you start thinking about High Ground now this next game you're going to notice that pet game plan is the exact same as the one before he goes ahead and is the first one deep into zone right here so you can build this 2 by one thanks a couple ticks doing it and now you'll notice he's literally in the best position possible he's got loads of time to look for a kill and look for a refresh so how does he get this refresh exact same strategy as earlier he's going to awareness check people by shooting out their floors like this guy not looking at his feet P's able to replace the stair at this point the guy can't react in time and get his own cone held P gets the stair in and he absolutely pieces this guy out and he goes ahead and do a bunch of really nice Peaks constantly making sure he's doing good rightand Peaks and finally this guy decides to whip out the shing shing and almost kills petot cuz unfortunately that's in the game at the moment have p a very very good call exactly like earlier he's in a scuff position there's loads of people blocking him shouldn't run out through these other people instead take a look what he does he goes out the backat exactly the same as before after the refresh use some of the whites that you've got you know blobs in this case maybe the siphon that you've got ticking potentially use that to go ahead and do a good rotate and go over everybody and get yourself into a good position and exact same as before he's also trying to stick to the edge not being dead center of Zone as well now for the next kill he's he does the exact same thing as earlier he spots somebody who's not aware of his feet this guy is you know pretty shambled not aware that it's not his bottom and he's able to get a very very free kill and at this point in time he's insanely stacked on M all he needs to go ahead and do is start thinking about that height take which I'll show you guys how he does at this game before we go into the next height take I want to tell you guys about the first earnings blueprint and the best part about this is it's completely free to access you're going to be learning exactly how to flank kite in solos how to go ahead and take Kite from reub as well as loads of other really useful videos you want to get better at solos this is absolutely perfect for you and again the best part is it's complete free so just click the link down below sign up finish this video and then you can go watch all of these amazing videos completely for free on the masterclass website so now this next height take is a little bit different and this is a more common height take that you probably have to do in a Solo game so the exact same setup as before he's on a high layer he's done this T box with this backward stair and what he does with the T box is holds the stair and looks up at height and the Really key thing with this box and why it's so strong and this is why ton2 fncs is doing this exact Strat every single moving zone is because you can chop out height without height being able to shoot you so if we go to the player height so Cooper right here Global champ from last year he's not able to see p he's not able to counter this chop out because of course peot is completely protected then the next thing that petb does which is really really important guys is whenever you try to go height unless the guy in height has like zero match you need to get damage onto the other player so where as kooper goes ahead and does the reset for the TP and he starts falling down P prioritizes getting damage on the other player which is really important so now kooper is basically forced to either try to go for height when he's low HP or just heal up and play midg ground exactly what happens P Agro even even further forces him to drop forces him to basically commit down to midr since he's got no mats at this point and now P bot's got a really easy time of holding height all he needs to do is set his TP and he's got a very easy time of you know getting a top two this game and basically bringing it down into the final Zone situation in a second here now one very big misconception that people have in solos is that you have to take kite at a specific time like first moving second moving third moving to actually win the game and this couldn't be further from the truth in my opinion you can take kite whenever as long as you do it in the correct fashion so as you can see right here Peter bot just got a refresh he's pretty stacked Ms he getes the exact same thing as earlier he goes front side he gets towards the end of Zone then he gets another kill right there in terms of somebody dying right on his wall as you can see so he didn't commit backside to get that kill instead he waited for the guy to come front side gets another kill gets all of the materials all the wood and brick from this player out there and what does he do is soon as he gets those refreshes is he has a look at height as you can see has a little look at height spots that play up on height is shambles only burning wood there the exact same chop out play that I just mentioned and now he's got height in the final Zone situation guys it is so important that you learn this exact same structure of your game so no matter what zone it is whether it's first moving or final moving you can execute this every single time and you can win more games now very easy 1 V one he's got more mats in the player he takes hype exact SS earlier and he just goes ahead and plays a nice little storm Peak pretty Mr Savage es right there and he's able to take the win and get himself second in the cash cup and make himself $33,000 and I definely think Peter bot one of those players that's going to win multiple of these cash cups going forward in the future all right that's all for this video guys again make sure to go check out the first earnings blueprint there's literally 10

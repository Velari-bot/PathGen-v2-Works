if you want to hit harder pump shots edit faster and be way more consistent when building you need to work on your Crosshair placement in this video I'm going to explain what good cross replacement looks like the best ways to practice it and tips you could apply to instantly improve it this video is a guide made for players of all skill levels so if I'm covering something you already know I put timestamps so you can skip to a part useful for you Crosshair placement is essentially the way you move and position your Crosshair when aiming building or editing good Crosshair placement is very efficient wasting no movement to complete the task while back Crosshair placement is less controlled causing more missed shots and inconsistent builds and edits I'll show a couple of examples when aiming you want to keep your Crosshair at head level that way you don't have to make a huge adjustment when trying to hit a headshot in this clip you can see that I'm holding my Crosshair too low forcing me to flick up creating a more difficult shot while in this clip I'm holding my Crosshair at head level and barely have to move it in order to hit Max damage foreign clip there isn't nearly as much movement going on not only allowing me to be more precise and consistent with my builds and edits but also lets me keep track of what's going on around me better the first step to getting good Crosshair placement is improving your mouse or stick control if you don't have good control over your mouse or controller you won't have good control over your Crosshair causing you to be less precise and mess up more the best way to improve your control is by aim training for keyboard players Kovacs aim Labs or any other third-party aim trainer is really good to improve your mouse control and aim I asked the name coach if there's any specific type of aiming that will help improve your mouse control more than others and he said it doesn't matter what kind of routine you play but you want to make sure your Crosshair is centered on the air maps and head level on Poland shotgun Maps but if your controller don't have any third-party aim trainer there's still plenty of creative maps to help improve your aim you got Raiders 1v1 aim those Raiders aim training map which you can play by yourself and panvel's headshot only box to it I put the map codes to all of them in the description when playing pay attention to where you're holding your Crosshair and try to keep it at head level just like in Kovacs I have a friend tell me that aimedling without aim assist helped him improve his stick control so that may be something you guys don't control it might want to try going into building and editing you want to make sure you get rid of any extra movement in your Crosshair when making edits Raider provides a good visual for this in the Crosshair training section of his map where it shows the most efficient path to complete different wall edits but you want to practice this with all your builds and my favorite way to do that is by cutting your scents in half and free build since your Crosshair movement is limited you're going to be forced to pay more attention on how you're moving your Crosshair and be more efficient staying on the topic of efficiency you want to be connecting your edits when building what I mean by this is have your last at the end where your next edit starts for example if I were to do a Minecraft classic I want to end my edit up here so my Crosshair is already in place to edit the stair down another example that's a bit more advanced is this edit down sequence every time I edit my Crosshair is already positioned to make the next edit I used to struggle with editing this wall because I'll flip the ramp this way didn't have to bring the Crosshair all the way across my screen to try to get to this wall then I realized if I flip the ramp in the direction of my wall my Crosshair is in the perfect position to grab and edit it as you start to pay more attention than your Crosshair you'll notice little inefficiencies that may cause you to mess up and be able to fix them and become more consistent I asked braids who is a pro in any Central how you guys cross their placement good and he says he just knows everything he's going to do before he does it which lets him know where his Crosshair needs to be ahead of time last thing I'll cover in this video is the best ways to practice Crosshair placement going from beginner level and work my way up to the more advanced stuff starting at Raiders mechanics map version 2 you have the Crosshair training section that I mentioned earlier to work on efficient wall edits from any angle you can set up all types of different scenarios and practice them here he has a new moving version of this on his nose mechanics map but I prefer being able to set up and practice scenarios that I struggle with in the same Map There's also editing from different angle section the only section I've really used has been the blueprint only so you could work on those long edits from a box away next is piece control tones which is helpful for getting reps in the same build sequence helping you figure out the most efficient way to complete the edits I used to do Tunnel 3 like this but found out another way to do it which runs much smoother and easier to do consistently foreign there's no right way to do a tunnel but just make sure when you run them you're always paying attention to your Crosshair and trying to connect edits when possible I already mentioned this earlier but free building on half your sense is a good way to get used to efficient Crosshair movement just make sure you don't do this for too long or you'll get back on your regular sense and it'll feel really high next way you could practice is by free building the goal is to challenge yourself with new moves and learn the most efficient way of doing them I tried to copy a free build I saw a pro do on Twitter and my cross replacement wasn't nearly as good as theirs but I learned how they did it and I'm going to continue to practice until I could get it down as good as I'm I'll show you a couple moves that you could try to replicate but if these are too easy for you I recommend watching a pro on Twitch and trying to copy a few of those thank you foreign thank you last but not least you have 1v1s all the ways to practice so far have been no pressure environments when 1v1 and Crosshair placement is not your only focus and it can be easy to forget but as long as you always remind yourself to keep good cross replacement you'll start to build that habit when fighting which will transfer the end game as well all right that's about it for this video I tried something a little different this time so let me know if you like this type of video and you want to see more I'm not going to be able to play comp this season because of work so a lot of my videos are going to be based around improving my aim mechanics and fighting if there's anything specific you want to see let me know in the comments like And subscribe if you enjoyed and use code how so I could quit my job peace

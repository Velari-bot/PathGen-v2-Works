so guys my last two videos have been about how to igl and how to frag in trios because as you guys know trios fncs is the next year's game mode but in today's video I'm going to be wrapping up the series by going over exactly how to be a support player in a fortnite trio for those of you guys eyeing the 2025 fncs and cash CBS that are going to be in the trios game mode a support role is often the role that people misunderstand the most that's why this video is going to be absolutely crucial for making you guys understand what a support player does and how you guys can Master being one be sure to stick around to the end let's get right into it so guys as a support player re resource management is the foundation of your role basically what this means is that you're responsible for ensuring that everyone has what they need especially in the critical moments of the game think of yourself as the team's backup player as a support player it's your responsibility to consistently gather resources not just for yourself but for the entire team this means keeping an eye on trees rocks and buildings around you to rearm and then Gathering those materials whenever it's safe even during the low points in the action your Fragger and your igl are focused on fighting and strategy so you're there to make sure that they don't have to worry about the resources another crucial term is going to be to balance your own usage with the names of the team support players often need to be self-sufficient in terms of materials meaning that you'll generally carry more materials than the other two prioritize wood early on for quick builds and fights and then switch to hard materials like brick and metal for the late game rotations it's your job to make sure the team has what they need without depleting your own reserves so keep a close watch on everyone's materials and health to ensure that nobody's vulnerable when it matters the most also make sure to stay actively engaged in tracking the resources of the team so so before every major rotation or big fight get a quick rundown of how everybody's doing on material count and ammo count being proactive here ensures that you can make the call for a quick swap if you or anyone else is low on any of these resources if you know that your Fragger is getting low on mats during a fight make sure that you're ready to drop some for them this is going to help them stay alive and make sure that they're always having what they need here's an example imagine that you're in the fifth Zone and your Fragger mats are running low because they've been engaging in several fights anticipating this you farmed Extra metal and wood earlier in the brief downtime between these rotations and fights you need to move close and drop off 100 metal and 50 wood to your Fragger this is really small amount however you need to understand this is crucial because it restocks and allows your Fragger to stay aggressive without breaking off from the fight keeping an eye on your resource levels and predicting when your teammates need a boost is what makes a support player invaluable now the second section involves positioning and communication these are vital for the support role because you're often the voice that spots dangers or opportunities that the igl and Fragger might miss In the Heat of the Moment the first tip is to keep yourself in an adaptable position position yourself between the IG and the Fragger ideally in a spot where you're not in direct line of fire but close enough to assist both roles this way you can quickly move forward to help the Fragger or fall back to support the igl with a quick build always stay aware of your surroundings in positioning yourself in areas where you can be an asset without becoming a liability another crucial aspect is taking on a broader perspective during these rotations support players should constantly scan the surrounding areas because while your fraggers focus on fighting and your igl's focus on tarping and directing your movement you should be scanning for nearby threats potential Escape Routes and any advantageous High ground or natural cover positions you should kind of think of yourself as the adviser to the igl and the adviser to the Fragger in both of their fields this added layer of awareness and fighting ability gives your igl and the Fragger the critical information they can use to adjust the team strategy when you guys are playing and then the final tip for this is to be prepared to call shots when necessary sometimes the igl might just be overwhelmed particularly in high stress moments like the endgame and as a support you're often the team's backup CER don't hesitate to speak up if you see a rotation path or an enemy weak spot in these cases short clear commands are key make it quick and actionable so that your team can respond effectively remember you're not the igl or the Fragger so you can't be doing their role however sometimes you might need to try to emulate their role In the Heat of the Moment or in a situation where something's going wrong in your rotation or your fight here's an example let's say that your Trio is moving towards a new Zone and you notice an enemy team above you getting ready to drop down you can quickly call out hold on there's an enemy team above us getting ready to push down this warning helps your igl pause and reposition and reconsider their game plan which can prevent a risky engagement or even an ambush and you guys getting eliminated as a support player you're constantly watching out for these moments where a timely call can keep the seam safe and in control of their situation and this leads me into the next section which is providing constant cover fire this is in my opinion a crucial aspect that a lot of support players tend to miss cover fire is one of the most important yet underappreciated aspects of the support role by suppressing nearby threats you create space for your teammates to execute their moves very effectively use this suppressive fire strategically so as support player your main goal with cover fire isn't necessarily to score eliminations but it's to disrupt and deter enemy actions so you need to use your AR to spray down opposing builds or apply pressure to teams watching your Fragger just a few well-placed shots can make the difference between your Fragger taking serious damage or you guys getting a lot of tags on them and moving in safely for the eliminations continually monitoring the flanks and blind spots that your igl and Fragger can't see that's a crucial aspect because the other two are often focused on the team ahead or the team that they're fighting your job is to be aware of these potential threats from the side angles above and behind you and keep rotating your perspective to make sure that no teams are sneaking up on your team and of course something else that's crucial is to stay mobile and disengage when it's necessary cover fire can be really risky because it involves you guys drawing attention to yourselves so make sure you're not overcommit and remain aware of how much risk and attention that you're attracting from enemy teams know when to back off and make sure to advise the igl and Fragger on when to do so and as a support you should always have sort of a backup exit in mind like I said the igl is kind of always moving forward and support players kind of focus on what's behind you what's around you what you guys need to do to stay alive in this Heat of the Moment here's an example so picture a situation where your frag just started fighting with a nearby Trio and then you spot a third team Watching You from High ground and you quickly use your AR to fireal several rounds at these enemy teams this forces The High Ground team to duck and maybe try to heal maybe you can get some tags on them basically it's just telling this High Ground team Hey listen leave us alone this gives your Fragger a bunch of time to finish their fight without being third partied it also gives your igl time to think clearly about what next to do think of cover fire as a way to protect your teammates instead of just attacking opponents because you are going to add valuable layers to the team's defense if you guys lay down this cover fire the next section is something a ton of players tend to overlook this is going to be carrying healing and support items constantly as a support player it's kind of in the name you're usually the one carrying essential healing and utility items so keeping the team's HP and shield up throughout the match is one of your top priorities obviously prioritize team wide healing items your inventory should be stocked with stuff like minis we talk with flow Berry fist stuff like that that's going to keep the whole team's Health really high and consistent since your igl and your Fragger often prioritize combat it's your job to carry and distribute these healing items to everybody in Peak condition also try to be proactive about topping up health so don't wait for team teates to ask for heals if you noticed that they're low offer them some heals offer them some Shield this small level of attention to detail can save the team in a lot of times where battles are going really really Intense or high stake situations where rotations are really important and of course managing your resources efficiently is going to be the third tip this is crucial because if you're holding two stacks of minis for example try to conserve them until they're absolutely needed try to try to stretch them for as long as you possibly can try to kind of budget your healing items to the best of your ability because every single bit counts especially in the endgame circles where HP can determine your guys' placement once again another example imagine that you're in the late game and your igl's taking some storm damage instead of having them pop minis in the open you can quickly box up and spray them with your flow Berry Fizz give them some shield and then preserve the minis for emergencies that are going to be later in the game which reduces their exposure time this allows your igl to heal efficiently without wasting more powerful resources and they can also keep moving around because flow Berry Fizz doesn't require you to be stationary when you're using it being this thoughtful and efficient with your heals helps ensure that the team is ready for whatever comes next during these stacked end games and then guys the final section is going to be something just to kind of tie a bow on this whole video is that mid game and endgame rotations are something that you guys definitely need to be thinking about I know the igl is going to be the primary one thinking about those rotations but you definitely need to supplement that in many cases rotations are often times where games are won or lost what you need to understand is that as a support player you play a critical role in helping your team navigate these tricky situations with the least risk and most control possible firstly keep track of rotation routes and spot obstacles that you may run into support players are often in the best position to see potential rotation paths call out areas where enemy teams may be camping or places that could give you safe cover as you rotate and move secondly use items like launchpads and bouncers wisely as a support player carrying and deploying these items can save the team in critical moments especially in these late game zones communicate with your igl to suggest they're used and be ready to lead if you're the one placing the item so let's say you have flow Berry Fizz be ready to sort of kind of pop it and know when to pop it and have the team rotate with you and then of course third you guys need to stay flexible and ready to adjust to any plan that may change L game rotations can be chaotic sometimes the igl's initial plan will need quick changes they might need to change the mind so as support you need to be ready to shift focus and assist in the adjustment if a rotation path becomes risky a final example can be that during a rotating Zone let's say that you notice that an enemy team has a really good aspect of cover a really good rotation path and you guys calm that to your iGo you need to point it out to the team and once everybody agrees to it lead the team to this area save the mats and position your Trio effectively for the rest of the end game recognizing these opportunities in the Heat of the Moment is what separates good support players from great ones well guys I know this video was a very dense one I hope you all enjoyed please let me know if you guys really find this series helpful I want to keep

in this video I'm going to show you guys how you can use the storm to your advantage everyone seems to be afraid of the storm and they never want to play in storm they're scared they're going to die but I'm going to show you the strategy to stay in storm stay healthy and use this storm play to your advantage all right so the first thing you need to do is land on the edge of the map somewhere it can be any side of the map it doesn't matter but your drop spot has to be near the edge of the map what you're going to do is just loot your drop spot like normal and you don't have to play storm every game I just do this if I'm in high El low lobbies or if I need to stay in storm to farm my mats and get better loot so right now I'm just looting the spot like normal checking around me making sure no one is coming towards me to key me and while I'm doing this I'm also looking at the map because most games The Zone keeps pulling in the same direction that it pulls at the start so right now I can tell that this zone is going to be pulling to the north side throughout the next two or three zones at least make sure to stack up some medkits as well if you're planning on playing Storm I have a medkit all bandages will be good to hold and the reason I'm playing storm in this game is because I have a typhoon blade and a bad shotgun so I want to stay in storm to find a pump and a mask and another reason is so I can rotate round in storm to the dead side and I don't have to go through the middle of the map and fight anyone all right so the storm has just closed in on me so I'm just going to chill here for a bit and get some Shield fish if we take a look at the map now you can see there's barely anyone within this area that I'm in in the storm whereas if I was coming up here a minute ago before the storm cloth there would be loads of people around this area and I'd have to avoid them or try and fight them but now this guy who's in Demon Dojo is rotating out because he doesn't want to stay in the storm and this gives me an opportunity to loot anything left in Demon's dojo and I know I'm going to be safe while doing this because most people aren't staying in storm as you can see now I found a shotgun and a mask I'm going to start making my way round to the dead side and getting out of the storm now one thing I like to do is once I get out of storm or once I get close to leaving the storm I will trade in the medkits for something else who that's a blob or a fishing rod anything like that I'd rather have those going into the end game than the medkits if I'm not planning on staying in the storm for much longer so right there you see I take a fishing rod and I'm just juggling that medkit so I can pop it once I get into zone now I've made it out of storm I've got the shotgun I want I got the mask and I've got nearly cap Maps as well so I'm pretty stacked from where I was earlier and notice that I've rotated all the way around the edge of the map completely safe and I haven't had to run into any of these people on the edge here now the one downside to playing storm in the mid game is that you can't play medkits or play heal off that well in end game because you will get storm sickness this doesn't matter as much this season because there's no Victory cups and barely any of the games go to heal off anymore all right let's take a look at a different game here a different example of playing in Storm very similar Zone to the last game we looked at pulling to this top left side of the map and as you can see my loot is not the best so far from my drop spot so the Zone has just closed in on my landing spot and I'm just using this time in storm to farm up the metal and I know I'm safe while doing this because there's never really anyone in the the storm so I can just chill here for a bit get a load of metal and then start making my way around to get some better loot once again doing the same thing going over to Demon's dojo and just Scavenging any loot that's left after everyone's already left this drop spot you know they've gone to Zone I can just chill here in storm and get some loot right there get a mask and a purple AR just for free like that still looking for a better shotgun though I couldn't find one so I am just going to head out of storm now and wrap my way around to the dead side and as you can see I was able just to rotate all the way from my drop spot loot up demon Dojo get a way better load out and now I'm just wrapping around the edge not really many people in my way whereas if I just went straight from my drop spot to Zone I'd be around all of these people here and probably get stuck there maybe end up in a fight and really scuffed but just by playing Storm I again an easy rotate and a better load out and I've capped out my mats as well and like I mentioned earlier once I get into Zone I dropped the medkits and right here I found a blob so swap that out and now I have a really good load out going into this end game thank you guys for sticking around until the end of the video if you're interested in private one-on-one coaching sessions with me then you can check out the first link down below

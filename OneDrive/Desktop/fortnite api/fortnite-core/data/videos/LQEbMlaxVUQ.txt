in this video I'm going to show you 10 piece control moves from beginner to Pro that you can use to dominate fights if you learn all these moves I guarantee you'll start winning way more fights and at the end of this video I'm also going to tell you the best way to practice peace control let's start with the most basic form of Peace control but this is also arguably the most important peace control move out of them all and this is simply getting a build in your enemy box now the main way to do this is when your enemy is in a box what most people would do is they would break this wall and then Place their wall first but when you do this you actually have no peace control in their box so what they're going to do is they're just going to edit out and edit out the back and then you've missed your opportunity what you want to do instead is as you break this wall you want to place the ramp first and then place the wall this will make sure that you actually have a layer to pece control them in this will make sure that you always have something in their box that will force them to panic and then you can take advantage of it so in full motion it looks like this as you can see the ramp went in and this works pretty much every single time but when you do this a problem you'll probably encounter is that the enemy will just edit out of the box and that leads us on to our next peace control move which is peace controlling from the side so one way to do this is by simply when you're pressuring their wall you you just place a wall here edit this cone and then like this and then you edit these four Towes but what's important is that you move to the left so you can't get shot and you can actually still place the cone and The Cone here simply by looking slightly more to the right then you can place the walls like this and as you can see they literally can't see you so what you can do is just go out to the side shoot and then reset instantly and it's pretty much a free shot and potentially even a free kill another way to piece control from the side is by simply placing the two cones here and here place them first and then you can go and place the wall edit a window like this and shoot them for a right hand Peak and then reset the wall but there's also another way to use window edits in your peace control moves and that is to Simply break the enemy's wall replace it with yours and then place a window for a right hand Peak place the cones and then like this and then you can shoot and reset another way to pie control is by piece controlling from above just like this to do this you want to place a floor on a cone do a double edit and then place two walls and a cone and then you'll be able to get a free shot if it catches them off guard but what most likely happens here is that by the time you've edited this they're already waiting and they're going to shoot you and that's why the more protected Peak like this is a lot better because as you can see you're protected and what they're going to do is they're going to shoot but because you're placing this wall they're going to accidentally shoot the wall like this which will either cause it to break and then you'll be able to get a free shot or they'll just shoot and it won't break but then you'll be able to shoot like this and reset before they can have another shot on you a common thing enemies do when you break their wall and get a build in their box is they try and edit down like this to escape the box as quick as they can which is why this next peace control move works so well and this is the next peace control move so to do this you just want to Simply edit down place a wall and then catch yourself on the cone and then edit for a window like this for a right hand Peak then place a cone and a wall and then you can shoot and reset something I see a lot of people doing is this peak right here and this is called the martos peak but what most people don't know is that you can actually peace control an enemy by doing this maros peak and this is how it looks so to do this you just want to set up the martos peak by placing the floor above you editing this tile and then placing a ramp above you again and then instead of jumping up and shooting like you would normally do you just want to Simply look here place a wall there a wall in front and then a wall to the right and then as you can see the enemy will be fully fully boxed they literally have no Escape so you can get a very protected shot like this and this is a very underrated peace control move another way to peace control is when you're box sighting an enemy you can actually blueprint edit peace control and basically this is how you do it what you want to do is make this edit here place a cone a cone below and then a wall to your right like this and then basically when this wall is one shot what you want to do is jump and grab the wall the same time but while you're in the air you want to make this edit here and as you can see as soon as you let go you're going to be fully protected like this so you can jump move to the left and get a shot and the reason you want to move to the left is because it just makes it a lot harder to hit for the enemy because you're obviously moving to a place where the wall is higher up so your head will be better protected here's what it looks like in full speed another way to blueprint edit piece control is if you're diagonally box fighting the enemy what you can do here is do a peanut BS Reddit place two cones here a wall here just in case they run out they'll be fully boxed and then you can break this take the wall and then do this four corner edit here but move slightly towards the left before you confirm so you're protected by this wall here and then you can release the edit and then you can jump and get a shot off now this next way to peace control is probably my favorite way to peace control because it works literally every time and for this you want to make sure that the enemy doesn't have a cone or ramp in their box and you want to be one layer above them diagonally like this what you can do here is place a cone two walls here just to stay protected and then double edit like this just to stay protected again place two walls here and then you want to break this wall take it like this do this edit like this and then place a cone in their box and they'll most likely just be sitting here staring at you because they're just flabbergasted that you just the most insane piece control ever so you can get an easy shot and you can also edit it like this if they're on this side of the Box here's how to do this in full speed now this next edit is really good if let's say You can predict that your enemy is going to run out into this box what you can do here is place a cone and then you'll be high enough to Sprint and jump all the way from here and you'll be able to piece control there and you'll be above the conee in just a few seconds this is called sprinting jump peace control and here's what it looks like and as you can see it's the freest peace control ever and you can do this in like just a second all thanks to sprinting and here's what it looks like in slow motion now I've covered 10 ways to peace control here's the best way to actually practice peace control I'm not going to lie to you and say

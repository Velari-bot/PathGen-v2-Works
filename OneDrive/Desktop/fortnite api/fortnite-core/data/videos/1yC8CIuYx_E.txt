in this video I'm going to show you guys how to get the best Crosser placement because it is one of the most underrated and important mechanics of fortnite good Crosser placement will give you both better aim and mechanics and I can bet almost all of you don't know how to practice it or maybe you don't even know what it is so therefore I will show you guys the ultimate guide on how to get the best Crosser placement like the top pros and like always before we get into the video make sure to use code Lolly FN in the fortnite item shop is by far the best way to support my content I also added a bunch of time stamp down below so if you guys want to skip to different parts of the video feel free to do so but without further Ado let's just jump straight into the video before I show you how to improve your Crosshair placement I first need to explain what it actually is and most of you might say I already know what Crosshair placement is but there's actually quite a lot that goes into it which I'm going to explain to you guys right now so here's a clip where I have bad crossair placement and here is a clip where I have good Crosser placement and you can quite easily see the difference in the two clips which is how I move my Crosshair so when I went for that triple edit instead of just flicking my mouse all around the place I basically just move it as little as I possibly can and look at this when I confirmed edit my Crosser will already be perfect to edit the cone and if I move a bit forward and then go for the wall edit my Crosser will be perfectly position so I can also edit the wall so if you're struggling to make backto back triple edits or backto back quart edits N9 out of 10 times is cuz you over flick your crossair way too much instead of just having good Crosser placement but how little you move your Crosser is only one part of having good Crosser placement another important thing is knowing where to look in order to place your builds so an example of this is if I want to place a wall right in front of me if I have my Crosser up here the wall will place right over there but instead if I look down the wall will place right in front of me and this is important to know cuz if I get sprayed I won't accidentally place the wall right over here I'll know that I just have to look down to be able to hold the builds in front of me and the same thing if I have a ramp in front of me and want to place a cone on this ramp instead of looking up to place the cone if I have good Crosser placement I can instead just look right in the middle of the ramp and The Cone will still place above me so if someone's ramping me and I want to Cone them instead of having to go all around to place the cone if I have good Crosser placement I can look right up here to place the cone and just to show how useful it is knowing where to place all your builds I'm going to show you guys one last trick so if I have an opponent that's boxed up like this and I want to get a cone and a floor above them instead of ramping and then getting the floor and Cone I can instead do this all I have to do is basically just look up and I can place the cone above them and then I'm going to be able to ramp and then get the double edit and this is a good drill to practice this so now I'm going to show you guys how to actually practice your crossair placement and this is the perfect map to do so this is my ultimate practice map and the code is on screen right now or you can search for lolan on fortnite and the map will come up and this map has everything you need to get better but before I show you guys the map I'm first going to show you guys some drills you can practice while free building to improve your crossair placement so just shoot the free build button and then it'll take you here so for the first drill I'm going to show you guys all you have to do is just do triple edits over and over again but while doing it try to move your Crosser as little as possible and if you can't do triple edits just use your blue remote to slow down your speed slowing down your speed while doing reboots is one of the best ways to practice so the second Dr is something clicks usually practice a lot to improve his crossair placement so all you want to do is edit a wall and ramp like this and then just keep going diagonally and the last R you should add to your free builds is for edits and that's basically when you edit from one tile away here are some examples and by the way this has nothing to do with the video but I just realized in the new update you can literally edit builds through other builds it's super weird and I'm not sure if it's even useful but but now you guys know all right so now I'm going to show you guys the rest of the map and how it works so basically when you spawn in you'll get these two remotes so the blue remote I showed you guys before is to change the speed so if you want to practice your Crosser placement I recommend using a slower speed and if you want to practice your edit speed or mechanics use a higher speed and then you also have a legendary remote and this one simply just takes you back to spawn so you click it and you get teleported back so now I'm going to show you guys the rest of the map and we have a bunch of different things here we have Crosser placement drills peace control tunnels and then we also have pre-fire practice free builds which I showed you guys before and then we also have Wall edits and Target which I'm going to go into right now so this is just an empty room and a wall with blueprints that tells you what to edit so just follow what it tells you and then shoot the target and this one is super good to practice your Crosshair placement on wall edit it it also helps a lot with your aim and Peaks but when using it try to move your Crosshair as little as possible and also try to pull out your builds after every edit cuz it's good to practice holding your wall after you're done on edit and then after you're done practicing this just use the legendary remote to go back to spawn and now you basically want to go over to Crosser placement drills and we're going to click on the first one which is wall edits so here you'll get the same blueprints as in the last drill but here instead of a single wall it's like an Ticor so just follow the blueprints like last time and if you think it's too easy you use up your speed to like 150 or 200 and then there's one that's basically the same as the other one but instead for floor and cones and this just looks like this and then there's also peace control tunnels and here you can select if want to practice a single tunnel over and over again or if you just want to cycle through them all and we're going to cycle through them all so we're just going to shoot right here and then it'll take you to these empty tunnels where you're just going to freebuild wherever you want to get to the end and this is one of the best practices you can get because it helps you practice your mechanics movement and of course your crossair placement and then also one bonus thing added to the map which is pre-fire practice this doesn't really have anything to do with Crosser placement but it does really help with your pre-fire practice the map code is on the screen right now but if you guys like the map make sure to click the leave button and then favorite and like the map right here obviously crossair placement will make you improve like crazy but it won't really matter if you're struggling with lag or high ping therefore I will show you guys a way to fix this all you have to do is to download gear up from the description below then open it and find fortnite and then just click on the Boost button right here after that gearup will find the best sub server for you which will lower your ping like crazy I went from around 30 ping to zero which is absolutely insane and now before you ask it won't get you banned because Gear Up doesn't interfere with any of the game data and it's totally Allowed by epic and if you're on Console I have a trick to lower your ping as well this is hyper EV which is a game acceleration router that you plug into console this will lower your ping and make your connection a lot more stable I left the links to both Gear Up and Hyper EV down in the description thank you gear up for sponsoring today's video thank you guys so much for watching I will keep updating the map all the time to make it better so if there's something you feels missing or that I should improve on the map let me know down in the comments and as a reward for watching to the end I will give a random person who likes this video and leaves a nice comment 5,000 v-bucks I also need to make the video 8 minutes so here's a random clip I hit oh my God

being an igl in fortnite isn't easy but mastering a few simple habits can make a huge difference today I'll break down the easiest ways to become a better igl let's jump straight in we're going to go straight to the end game for Ice Bird cuz that's what he wanted to focus on Ice Bird's question was getting refreshes in the end game as a trio let's figure this out jumping on board Ice Bird here you're in a good spot let's just take a team look like just team Scout understanding here right he's got Max mats on Ice bir he's got Mobility he's got the the the bad katana teammates got the other bad Katana but still good mats lots of ammo to spray with and then finally I don't even know how to say this guy's name but same thing same same ability type which is really good just least to have some consistency there um and yeah your teammate has a bunch of AR ammo so hopefully you guys can sort that out but regardless I'll talk about this real quick here cuz I know you wanted to talk about refreshes but I'm going to Deep dive into this entire game here uh and we'll focus a lot on refreshes here this is something that again as you just as you saw me talk about 5 minutes ago but ABC rotates right option rotates you guys right now aren't planning this I mean this Zone's NE is already popped right we could even go back before and you guys are doing the same thing so now right while you guys are in the map remember that drawing I made this is you guys you're in the map right here you're in the map you're in your own map looking at Zone reading it this is exactly what I'm talking about no bueno now you're looking now now now where do we go let me see here let me Scout let me look up up here all right now we're going right meanwhile I don't even know who it was but this team's already going or this team's already pred or that team's already left right and it's not like it's the end of the world again fortnite competitive can be played in infinite different ways pretty much right like you can you could do this every time and probably still be successful it will it be a lot harder yeah it will you're going to have to get a refresh later on cuz you're going to be you know maybe this game was great but the next game you do something like this you just don't play in your rotate and you Scout ahead and you then you end up going late and then you get held and you get storm fought and then you you'll eventually you'll realize like wow I should just follow the ru look here as for this I think this is a great play I think that instead of this um instead of sorting down I think I think what we should do here is just one dash down say hey guys cuz you can see Zone actually wait this is the other way wait oh I thought the Zone was that way what the what the flip all right I don't know why you're doing this son hold on wait let me let me look let me take a second here I thought you were I thought Zone was um to the north um yeah I think it's actually fine I think you could you could probably still go down there if you want to just follow this I think you could just use one then one slide box here wait a second and then maybe use wood here I mean you would have to only really block your top and floor right just just I just don't prefer ever multi- dashing because it just leaves chance for you to die and get fried and then here you know you're in a low pressure situation especially since you called the rotate to be down into a low pressure situation right if let's say you told your teammates like we're going to rotate right through the middle of the lake like this would be something something where you land and you know this is about to go down and you're going to have to use metal right versus hey everybody let's just rotate we're going to wrap all the way around we're going to go this way all the way around if you use metal on this rotate for some reason right when you can clearly see in the mini map there's no one out here this is a a waste of mats so this is again a waste of metal here that you're never going to get back all right and then especially this is something that I see people struggle with a lot right you're getting in here right you're building your metal and then you're overbuilding the metal right in the sense that like you don't obviously now you're getting fought but you're not actually understanding the process of when to switch off of it does that make sense so that's that's a huge thing right like if you're let's say it's not a bad it's not a bad thing at the base level to rotate into a non-pressure situation and just use metal like it's not great but it's not the end of the world but once you see that yes this non press situation you wrote it into you think it's you think it's non pressure and then it is non pressure right where you're no one's really shooting at you again I know in the situation you're getting fought but I think this is still would have been the still case um once you see it's not pressure you can switch back to wood or switch back to Brick and then same thing like in the same note on the same exact style right you're getting fought okay all right boom we got space once you know you have you're not getting pressured once you know you're in control of the situation right you don't have to use metal this is all wasted metal like you're not this these are not jumping in your box they're not continuously spraying they're not box for you they're not spray like you and your teammates are literally on each other and like I'm 4X I'm twox speeding this right like right that's a pretty clear like they're not actually fighting me they're just kind of just maybe just got caught on a rotate that's fine but this is extra waste of metal that you're never going to get back even using brick here would have been better again I want to be clear it's okay to use metal but you got to really get really really good at that switch like oh it's good okay I'm switching I'm switching to Wood here switching to Brick got to get off as soon as possible I think it's pressured oh it's not okay back to back to my MK and then same thing here it's just a little bit blind right talk about this a ton I know I've watched it before I mean this is an easy just Scout you're right here you're on this you see no one to your right maybe this RM guy you probably would even know he's there all you do is just floor stair cone and you'd see out of this right here if you want to break it you could put a wall and then break it and edit the wall and now you see perfectly right and probably you could probably also break this as well that's it that that's literally it and if you want to be f with it let's say you want to be really discreet with it like you think this guy up here on height is about to fry you if you come up here he's going to absolutely laser you okay I'll be really discreet with it let me see what I can do here let me see so I will come from this box and I'll edit this wall and I'll put a cone here and I'll just jump I'll jump Scout it's less chance of him to see your builds less chance for him to see you now you'll see it oh I would see right here off of this exact angle that there's a team to my left and they're not opening I can't tell what they're doing visual wise cuz I'm not in the game but I would see that bush right there as the prime spot I would go straight to the bush and not saying that no one would be in it obviously hindsight we can see nobody's in it but you don't have to get close to it you could even just play this hill here boxer here I mean then let's say something happens you're getting sprayed by these two teams you could just push yourself against this or Katana around and get to here and then you're out of the out of the spray or best case scenario right best case scenario in this game hindsight now we can see it but best case scenario is you get to the bush now boom skie dead hold the guy whatever you want to do this guy comes in late dead right you're just able to save more mats not to waste anything instead you blind rotate with katana and it turns into a mess right you blind rotate straight into everybody right like you are literally in the middle of everybody we just look at this I mean even if we just look at the mini map you are quite literally right in the center so this is just a not planned blind rotate and uh I know your question was how do we get refreshes in the endgame right getting refreshed in the game that was your goal here but these are all things that set you up to be to to struggle for getting refreshes right if you're constantly needing refreshes that's not how you should be playing the game you should be playing the game with all right we're in in game every single time with 555 or or 333 or even two 255 whatever it is like you're in that situation every single time but if you're in a situation where you're 111 every game that's not how you're supposed to be playing the game right again you're getting you're going to get focused here and just like this position and I'll talk about this because I feel like I have have to um this position is also in the open if we look at this right I could definitely see myself having you wrot it here you know let's say this is exactly what you did do and you got focused but I would still say and I'm going to say now that this is a much better position it's also just I mean look at Skully right that's where he is he's here so it's not as Center like it's definitely not just by the way the zone is but regardless I'm always going to prefer being able to stick myself under a hill here or at least to the side of a mountain rather than in the open like you are quite literally like pinched from every angle like there is nothing that's blocking you the only thing is this small little Ridge and slight like Hill down right like that's it like that's it's not blocking you but it's going to give you maybe a slight chance to just build an extra layer which obviously it does here right you have this like these half wall layers right so you can you can make a bit more space but that's why it's that's why it's even even even just a worse position to be in [Applause] all right so SC your rotates looks like you're doing that again keep your eyes I'm I'm assuming you're the igl cuz I think you rotated and let the rotate twice keep your eyes on the prize my brother this is a simple guys just a Teleport there mark it I'm looking around right I'm Scouting Around okay yo give me mats all right bet let's go all yo watch the team on height here that's all we got to worry about just make sure you guys have a visual on height just just they're over peaking and if if it goes this way it's going to be the hardest rotate just get an get some eyes get a visual I like to say that a lot of my teammates get a visual on it get a visual on this understand the scenario because if they're just out here let's say they're drooling they're just saying let's just spray this team in the bush no no spray this team right and you're like let's go let's go let's go okay yeah go go go boom and then this is just the first time I've ever seen it or ever thought about a team being this high up or let's say they were looking down Spring right get a visual of it have a have an understanding like just take a mental screenshot boom screenshot boom okay now I can go look so now just off that screenshot on my own head l 10 seconds ago I know there's a base on the hill I know there's bases below the hill I know there's bases very close to me that has a lot of space right we go back boom lots of space here base below the hill base on the hill right and you can just continue to get more and more and more every time you look so getting a good M screenshot on the hardest rotate which in this case this would be the hardest rotate for you right just off of easy two second look you can tell this is going to be the hardest one you're going up a hill you're going towards a bunch of teams versus like here right you pull Zone pretty much here it's dead side anywhere over here dead side you would rotate around and anywhere over here again you could just be patient you could either wrap left on these teams do or you could go through so you found your hardest rotate or I did at least right now keep your eyes on the prize that's the big thing here right now you're going to fall back into the same exact Loop that you were in before back here right you're spraying a team you're holding somebody you're not doing the things that are related to your role these are things you can quickly assign a triple spray here let's say this guy does teleport right let's just paint it out paint the picture ice Bird's perfect scenario the guy teleports bang does a does a trio even really kill him like I could see it happen happening but when he teleports he's going to instant build right and depending on how your Dam how you know how you hit your shots if it if you guys all bleed through then of course yes you're going to actually kill the guy right that's great but is is it likely that you guys insts to kill this guy is you know how how long would this take would this take you have 6 seconds on the clock if this guy teleports right now you know are you going to kill him before the Zone shows uh secondly is this guy likely to teleport with six seconds on the clock like um probably not right and lastly most importantly is even if you guys get this refresh right in a in a placement based format what is this doing for you are you getting this refresh can you get the refresh how would you get to the refresh right with 6 seconds on the clock you would have to play if this refresh happened right you would have to play for Zone Pole to be here you would have to You' have to kill this guy in the next like right now he teleports boom teleport kill him knock him out of the game you'd have to wait make sure no one else ever focused you Zone pulls this way Zone would have to pull this before you get the loot and then and then you you'd get the loot there you go that would be your refresh all right so again eyes on the prize focus on your own rotate this is just you're still locked in on this for no reason and it looks like you did have a decent understanding of where you wanted to go so that's great like another thing you should always be doing and I'm seeing that you're not necessarily doing but you're also like it's not the worst maybe maybe this guy's doing it yeah this guy this guy's doing it bad and this is so I I'll put this on you iper because I think you're the igl here is you should be leading your teammates on how you want them to rotate right I saw how you rotated it was fairly good it was low to the ground I mean you're using a katana where you have to dash so you know if you go up let's say you guys all triple Dash straight up what's going to happen you're going to All Die you're literally going to get fried one of you guys are going to die you go straight up here you're going to die cuz you're just stopping you're dashing then holding yourself in the sky then dashing right it's very slow so when you're using the katana here or the the blade whatever we want to call it whatever you guys to call it Dash really low so even right there right fall fall down and then Dash and then fall down and then Dash right and again leading your teammates on how you want to rotate is going to help you a ton because now when their last guy rotates this is the guy that's going to be seen by everybody right they see two people going they're going to watch this guy not you they're going to see this guy so lead them on how you want it to happen he goes boom you didn't lead him how it's going to happen he goes He follows what you're doing he goes again he stays really high and then he goes again and get stays really high while his teammates are already landed so tell them what you want to do tell them how you want to lead that's the same way like okay on this rotate you guys use wood use brick use metal I want you guys okay on this rotate just stay with me right you're telling them how you want them to go but just in in every part of the game you need to tell them use use this the katana this way Dash once and then slide all right dash once slide then Sprint and then crouch in 360 like that's what they're that's what that's what you want to do that's what they're got to do keep them on the same page make sure you're you're executing your plan so great thing here is just yeah control that dead side you guys did a pretty good job with that just pushing this team away cuz this team definitely could have wrapped towards you this turned out to be great and again looks like you are leading right so this confirms even more you are the igl of this team you are the leader of this team you're putting yourself in the spot you're taking control this is good you guys have pulled the Zone that's great and overall right if we were just look at the snapshot right here if I was to skip right here 15 minutes ago C straight to this moment your BS are great 56 65 and I think 86 that's that's solid your heals solid your ammo solid this is like put me in this situation and I'm having a happy time I'm I'm great I'm great about it this is this is perfect it's not amazing it's not like 555 obviously but I'll take it here you are right trying to find this team I can eventually just give it up right now it's definitely the time just just give it up let's let's let it go it's all good now we got to got this rotate and again just same error that you made before is you're filling into the role that you're not supposed to play there's a reason why they've picked you to be their igl there's a reason why you've even came up to the plate and said I'm going to be the igl of this team I'll be the I'll lead you guys I got it right so play the role so now you're rotating late teammates are ticking twice now and you're going blind and it ends up being fine cuz it's say 32 player what seems to be to me an East open Lobby or I mean I can't maybe no disrespect to any of these players by the way but maybe you guys name can name any of these players the only person I know in this Lobby is Iceberg so I don't know anybody else here so you can just look at them and just Baseline of that and say I'm getting I'm getting bailed out of these situations and also I will say that as much as I'm griping on you for uh wanting to scout your rotates and plan ahead and fill that role I really think you should uh and again no disrespect to you Ice Bird I think that at your level this is something that is probably a challenging Lobby for you I would say or it's somewhat challenging um so you should be feeling that role and trying to play extensively in that role right how you Scout your rotate plan ahead do those things just do your role but if I was in this situation knowing this Lobby right because let's say I would this would be like I'm queuing up into an East open 1K ladder this would be the lobby I'm playing against I'm playing a bit more loose I'm going to do what I just saw you do I'm going to like so don't take it as me being hypocrite take it as I have more experience and and I'm okay with rotating blind because I know I'm mechanical enough my teammates are mechanical enough we're fast enough we can react enough and we can just we're just going to go for as many kills as we want right this is like the exact same way as like Peter bot like you know I tell you to scout ahead but Peter bot never Scouts ahead well [ __ ] he's he's he's Peter bot like like what do you want me to do he's just going to be doing his own thing and he's going to be running through the lobby cuz he knows how easy it is so um with that being said yeah always play your rotate always C ahead and play your role here so that was one refresh you went for right here's another kill you got I don't it's lagged don't know how you got it but looks like it was a solo all good U also I'll notice here just it's not the biggest deal but I think to be more consistent with your tarps Ice Bird and to be to have a better perspective of what is happening right so for example here actually I'll I'll just show it number one like when you're tarping here as an igl as a tarper don't just constantly box wall edit through the wall box edit this wall box edit this wall box right like keep it in a straight line we all know right boom boom snap snap boom boom snap snap boom boom snap snap right like you're not putting that front wall to save the build and also give yourself that extra visibility because if we go back here you would have probably have caught this guy in a way better fashion and probably gotten damage off and it would have been just a free a free kill right so your style of tarping is full box edit the wall full box edit the wall so you do that full box edit the wall and because of that timing right imagine you would have caught this guy right in your box like perfectly in your box this half second that took you down at the wall you would have saved it fallen in boom he got out bang right and then again even even besides this point let's say no one jumps in your box that's lucky on itself right tarping in a straight line and being like not having that extra build one saves you build two gives you that perspective you can actually look around you way easier you're you're not doing as many movements you're just going through it it boom boom boom right so to help you actually have eyes in the lobby bar the next thing that's really important is I don't know if this is your floor or not I don't think it is because this guy built brick and this is your or and he landed here as well and I'm also saying that because you didn't put floors here at all either so once you're in the zone Ice Bird when you're in the zone right this box here has to be your floor this box has to be your floor because what you're doing and what everybody does and it's not an unfair thing to do be to be doing you're doing the right play um is you get in zone and you look for refresh you get in zone you spray a wall and you get in zone you preit the team you get in zone right you have the 5 seconds on the clock we're going to use four of the 5 Seconds to spray a team and see if we can get a kill okay one second all right now we got to go right so when you're locked in again same thing cone on your top floor or floor on your top like tarp it in all right lock in boom boom lock these two boxes in close off our back forget these boxes right they're there for if the Zone pulls back here you go now you're going up again same thing here you know you're going by someone's tarp you got to get better at this because this this wasn't a situation where you went by anybody's tarp so I didn't point it out right maybe here but again this is his floor now you're going up by this tarp I would hope that you would want to put a floor here there you go putting the walls in the right spot and then again something I always like to do just based off the lobby couple things you could do here number one if you're playing in a more stacked Lobby near this is a really serious game here then I would definitely recommend you using what here build out metal this is Great Scout a scout box getting extra Viewpoint perfect right good really really solid here great then once you know you're about to rotate oh okay we're going to go a straight line this is a really clear path easy got this right here all right guys I'm using wood here stay with me wood wood wood wood wood all right oh we're going to he all good you know let me just put a wood floor I'm getting sprayed let me put a wood cone no big deal right now you're to the front side now metal and metal two boxes of metal floor on the top floor on the bottom all right sit and wait okay where's the one again Zone again ready wood wood wood wood wood box of metal right so this rotate have been saved you could have saved a ton of hard mats um secondly uh on this note here is what I would do if I was you is I would tarp this out and tell your teammates it's a straight line tarp I I would communicate this with your teammates like what your intentions are don't let it be so like based off of your just Randomness right well I feel like going in a straight line here now I feel like zigzagging to the left now I feel like like right if you know you're going to do that you should know here right away a good igl good tarper will know like all right I see all right yep I see rotate I'm going this is a straight line tarp guys you ready let's go boom boom boom boom boom right straight line tarp means they can look for all these edits they can they can control everything they can just it's like you have low ground essentially you have just such a great Viewpoint all around you is just you just you're in a straight line there's no zigzagging there's there's no it's not hard to see which wall is getting smacked on from a team behind you right as compared to a snake tar where you're you're you're kind of routing through here you won't know if that back wall is getting hit on or not you w know if you're getting lurked on a straight line tarp is beautiful right it's it's it's really an easy way to get a ton of refresh presses so if you're doing that let your teammates know let it be clear and and he could have probably have looked down a bit and probably killed this guy right that would have been an easy kill this guy has no mats this whole Trio has no mats right boom that's that's a ton of a ton of mats and free kills all right so now you're about to go again got mats from your teammates it's great okay now blocking your head this just seems like a simple tarping thing I I think most importantly like you need Variety in your tarp I I I got told this last night when I was doing a bunch of box fight tokens that I have zero Variety in my box fights I got zero variety and I was like well you're you're right like I really have like I do the same play I'll take a peanut butter I'll take a window at it I'll take another window at it I'll sit behind my thing I'll spray all from the similar side similar angle and similar similar timing right then you compare me to Peter bot and he's got a 100 different V varieties he's got different different angles shotgun Dam like he just everything right that's just a difference between me and Peter bot this is the same situation as you in a tarp right your tarps are the exact same we've all been watching you just do metal cones and floors and walls and metal cones and floors and walls and that's it right keep it different maybe do stairs maybe do not that you have to catch your catch the guys in the match off guard but I mean it's clear that you don't have to be doing this every time and it's clear that this won't work every time you're not going to be able to consistently just do this every part of the Zone someone's going to get your floor and spray you down it's going to be over so having variety and being able to play off of each scenario is really important here and then also just reps of doing it seems like you shouldn't be messing this up if you are confident in tarping you shouldn't be having a a a gap blocked here because that gets your teammate fried which I've talked about this a ton and I think you probably listened to this Ice Bird as well in previous uh Tuesday thesis maybe a couple weeks ago a couple Tuesday thesis weeks ago but there was a time where it was a dual game and the guy was like how how do I get refresh this year and I said every time you're going for a refresh you take damage you can't go free for refreshes if you're low HP so every time you tar this and he takes damage right now you have to wait now you have to heal now you really need to refresh on this guy well you can't do it now because now your both your teammates got fried or one of them got fried and he's stuck there healing with him right so this matters right and then here right in this in this scenario pushing front here so drastically is is not the play here wait for the zone to expand a little bit more you're here okay you're here you see a guy in the wood you can you can definitely tell there's someone here right and you see there's someone here okay you know you saw he doesn't even the guy's so bad he doesn't even know you're coming by him right you know he's in there okay he knows you're in there at this point it's a box it's right here box up get ready to stop cuz now you're sliding more and I thought you were going to keep sliding you're sliding more and more and more into this other team right at this point again even if this was still a situation it's a box and stop it's wall flip the stair to be face on that team so you don't get pred put another St here so you don't get pred wall wall look back for my team right okay good looking back let's say we just pause here let's just imagine you didn't ever run like this right that's where we would have gone left left left right and then I would have gone in this box and I would have also killed this solo back here or we would have been able to look back here I would have had your teammates start to spray back or look back clear the back whatever but just don't push front so much there just slow it down again this is great rotated through perfect now you're here you're on front side low ground great great damage no mats in this situation your teammate whoever this is could just lead for you you guys have no builds just tell him to lead great he drops m whatever get the mats I would say also depending on your Trio just if this guy I'm just going to assume these are the roles right you're the igl this guy's the Fragger this guy's the second frag right or the support player if the Fragger always has the last mats either he needs to fully lead into a fight because that's what your probably your best bet is like having him lead using his mats or he needs to drop everything like he needs to have nothing like not saying that the Fragger should always have no mats but this guy if this guy's the Fragger and he's already hardly dropping your mats here when when you guys already have such low positioning right if he's not taking taking the initiative to start tarping and leading I can tell that when you run out of mats again he's going to take him five years to drop the mats again and it's going to get you slowly slowly slowly killed here so not saying to happen this scenario but just something to think about right so that's why a great system to have in trios is the Fragger drops the support player mats support player drops the igl mats right so it all comes from one player everything everyone gets one player's worth of mats right play Med kit Don it in right and while you're playing Med kit here I think that you're probably having some conversations like this but I don't know what happened to your to your teammate it doesn't really matter but um yeah what are we doing here all right R medkit all right ready we're going to sort in three times two times sort in one time slide boom whatever the play is do it execute it be on the same page again I don't know what your coms were so it's possible read up now you're here and now your teammate gets a kill below you okay it's slow down get up above me like you can easy see right get that finish break up or help him break up you could definitely have helped him there but it's all about regardless that the whole mindset here has to be get together get together there is no point you guys you guys are so useless as a solo this is so useless as a solo him in the refresh I know he has a kill here so like this is a little bit different he's he's taking his time he has to get the refresh it takes time but just be patient then for you while your teammates you know waiting for the the the invis thing to go away and him to get the refresh and break through you could spray through for him you could wait you have 13 builds right now you could go up and start creating layer space for him whatever it is right boom you go for a trade-off damage and you're not actually leading for helping your teammate your teammate comes out he's out here struggling just all all that would have been right just break the floor for him you would have got him out right there he's literally right there but you your awareness or his awareness or your your guy teammates who dead awareness is so bad that you don't know that's just one Flo now he's breaking out coming out now he's coming out here now I'm here I'm here I'm here oh my God I'm dead right it's frustrating you can't play the game out like this you can't like these high pressure situations has got to be led properly so take your time right get get better awareness understand where your teammate is that he if he drops down there gets refresh got it there's more than enough time and I'm not even speaking just off of like bias VOD side POV like I'm just saying like there was genuinely a ton of time for you to do that secondly we'll go back here just to talk about this you should never especially with builds you should never be just willing to run across a lay like this and take like a straight just like run against the wall take a shot like especially if you know your teammate's still alive and you know he got to refresh like your goal is like look I'm coming I'm here for you just find your way out let's say you just can't see him like he's invisible you have no idea where he is find your way out okay I'm going to I'm going to try my best to use all my mats you're going to come through here you're going to damage that guy or don't whatever it is you're going to put a stair here double edit up wall double edit up like you're going to fully tarp this with all your mats knowing your teammate just got got 68 builds or at the minimum 150 right 15 builds right 150 mats so you know he know he's coming to you right lead your teammate here the next thing is even let's just say this scenario is exactly how you wanted it to play out this is perfect you damage the guy you knock him you got to Cone yourself right away and you looks like you did but I think it was a little too slow if that guy was fast enough you're dead there boom so because you didn't fill your role again because you filled the role of a Fragger running against the wall pumping this guy trying to get trying to take him out now your teammate who is the Fragger actually got the refresh for you and you didn't assist him because you were filling a role that wasn't yours right you're busy doing this not busy focusing and helping your teammate now your teammate's dead and there goes all your mats so you got the refresh it wasn't at the perfect timing it wasn't the best scenario but you got it it happened ni game just like that still overall I would not look at this game if if this was a major tournament for you I'd be like this is [ __ ] huge bro we just got a third place we just got six kills I'm happy on to the next let's go I'm not going to gripe on it too much this you know I'd be happy with this as well and in a in a major tournament this would be a great game to have so that's it man like your refreshes you got them I think just general notes for you Ice Bird is one Scout your rotates that's a big big thing scouty rot Ates number one you got to do that consistently number two fill your role right fill your role stop spraying so much like just just tell your teammates spray this wall on onto my role like sorry I can't help you I'm focusing my rotate that's not a bad thing like that's what you're that's what you should be doing that's that's that's how you set your team up up for for the right position um yeah fill your role and then that'll help you a ton it through all this in-game process and all these like just scuffed situations you put yourself into and then the last thing would just be getting better at tarping you know using different variations of tarp and leading your teammates like I'm straight line tarping what did that mean they're doing this right or now let's go stay ahead with me I'm blocking I'm using wood now come down right just being able to use different mat types will help you a ton CU this was your tarp like you literally just got in went metal metal metal all the way through then metal more metal I don't know if this is you or not but I don't know somewhere in here just you switched up it's hard to tell but yeah and then the other one was just simply just don't slide front just slow down slow slow slow wrap the teams off first and then back up a bit and wait just wait for your teammates to get to you and then go in it's the same exact this is like the way the the way you're playing here when you're going in really soon uh instead of slowing down is the same way as like you reboot your teammates and they just Glide to Zone like what are you doing just come land on me let me give you my mats let me split you mats let me split you ammo let me split you heals let me give you a gun right slow down like doesn't have to be so fast here just relax I know you're tanking a 10 tick storm but I've got you I'm right here it's better to be together that's it cool Iceberg you got any questions when you want me to focus on my role more do you want me to become more of a hard igl and just make my fraggers do more so I can focus on rotates or is it more to it you're 100% on like the the situation like yes you yes you should become more of a hard you should be a hard igl especially in these lobbies it's not hard like your teammates could literally be drooling at like on their fingers and still frag out in these lobbies like it's not hard so yes you should be a hard IG the only thing that's going to really affect you is not being a hard IG like if you're just hardly igiling consistently or just not doing it as consistent as you could then yeah it's going to affect you and yeah your frager should you that's their role like think about as a team think about like as a pie right if you IG you're done okay your frers just have to do what their job is they just got to do their job everyone's got to do their job I don't come over here and say Jack tarp start start the tarp over for me I'm going to take over your frag because you're not doing it enough I just lead my role I just play my role and I trust my teammates to play their role again there's times where like you should all be spraying together and you should all be looking to do the same thing and like yes technically you're spraying a team with your three other your two other teammates that's kind of feeling a you know Fragger esque roll but then again like I told you like I showed you okay zon's in 5 seconds I'm going to spray for one more second at 4 seconds I'm going to turn around and go it doesn't have to be like that communication like all right guys I'm going to spray with you till three and a half seconds then turn around it just like just make it simple I'm spraying with you guys oh I got to go I'm look at zone two one go all right come come come come come right and you're leading it like all I got to look at Zone just be ready ready all right let's go we're out all right that's a wrap thank you guys so much for being here welcome back to Tuesday thesis I appreciate that with that

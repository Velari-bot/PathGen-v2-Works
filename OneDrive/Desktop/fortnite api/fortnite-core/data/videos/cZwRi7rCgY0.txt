in this video I'm going to be going over all the best gear you can buy for competitive fortnite I'll go over things like the best keyboard and mouse best monitor best mouse pads and more for each of these I'll give two options one being the best possible one you can buy no matter the price and the second one being the best value option for people that are shopping on a budget but still want gear that is more than good enough to go pro using the first thing that I'm going to talk about is also one of the most controversial mice good gaming mice are abundant and it often boils down to your own personal preferences and taste for the people shopping without a bud I think that the best Mouse regardless of its price tag currently is the Razer Viper V3 Pro while it is quite expensive generally costing around $160 it is more than worth the price it has a medium size which fits most hand sizes with very reliable clicks scroll wheel and side buttons I've had a G Pro superlite among other mice in the past and generally something is faulty with at least one of the features that I just listed but with the Viper V3 every aspect of the mouse is extremely solid and very durable which means it will last you a very long time as for my budget choice I'm going with the Razer Cobra this mouse has been lowered down to an insane price of only $35 this mouse is a very good build quality which is the standard for Razer mice in general now as Razer as a gaming accessory brand has become much much better in the last 2 years the clicks side buttons and scroll wheel all feel a very high quality as if this is a mouse you just spent a ton of money on the switches they use for the clicks are actually the same ones they use for the most expensive mice meaning you're getting the best possible switches for just a fraction of the price even though this mouse is cheap it will not hold you back in any way when it comes comes to fortnite competitive or gaming in general since the introduction of Na Central and reload cups tons of people have been struggling with packet loss and high ping but Gear Up booster is just the application that can fix all of those things gear UPS anti- packet loss feature uses highquality routing to ensure that you don't experience any packet loss while you play the best part about gearup though is the Ping reduction gearup uses the most optimal routing to ensure that your connection is the lowest possible latency giving you the best possible ping if you're on console and want this to don't worry Gear Up has a gaming router with all the same effects called hyper EV tons of Pros like Peter robot tickle and Cooper use it go down in the description and try it out for yourself today the next peripheral I need to talk about are keyboards while keyboards might not seem like the most important thing for competitive fortnite now some of the more expensive keyboards actually offer features that give you a competitive Advantage the keyboard I recommend if you're trying to get the best one money can buy is the wooting 60 H+ while $180 is a steep price it will make sense when you realize how much of an advantage it gives you the first insane feature is rapid trigger to try to make it make sense without confusing you basically instead of having to fully wait for the key press to unpress after activating it rapid trigger dynamically changes the actuation point and deactivation point to wherever you let go of the key first and wherever you begin to press the key again this means that for example while spamming edits instead of having to wait for your edit key to come all the way up before starting your next edit you can immediately press down before before it comes all the way up to start your next edit this keyword also allows you to completely control the initial actuation point up to the millimeter with their software it's not realistic for all of us to to drop $200 on a keyboard and that's okay because the budget option is actually the keyboard I've been using for the last 3 years and it's still a really good keyboard the gk61 is a 60% mechanical gaming keyboard which means that it doesn't have a number pad or its own function keys however that only leaves more room for your mouse which is a benefit you can choose any switches that you like with them but I recommend you go with the Gaton optic yellow switches Gaton optic yellow have extremely fast actuation making this keyboard one of the fastest even for its incredibly low price the durability of this thing is insane also as I said I've been using it for years and never once have I encountered a problem with it the build quality feels really solid and overall feel of the keyboard is nice too the next important piece of equipment for competitive fortnite is your monitor monitors have all different types of specs such as resolution refresh rate and response time since in fortnite only 1080p is necessary the most important specs for competitive are refresh rates and response time a monitor's refresh rate is the number of times per second that the screen updates with a new image so if your monitor is only 60 HZ but you're running your game in 144 FPS you're only seeing 60 of the 140 FPS that's why when choosing a monitor the most important thing to think about are the limitations and capabilities of your PC if your PC gets 144 or 160 FPS there's no reason to get a 240 HZ Monitor and as for anything past 240 HZ such as 280 or 360 HZ monitors I think it's completely unnecessary even the best PCS in the entire world can't get 360 FPS in endgame and what you might be thinking well even if it's not cons consistent end game it's still an advantage for Creative in mid game that's just not entirely true either rather than give you an advantage all it does is make you feel like you're playing on two different games at different points in the game and the lack of consistency makes it hard to build edit and especially aim for my recommendations first off if you run 144 to 165 FPS you should get the Acer Nitro 23.8 in 165 HZ monitor this monitor has a 1ms response time making it one of the fastest along with being cheap coming in at only $110 now if your PC gets 240 FPS or you want to get a monitor that's future prooof if you ever upgrade your PC you can get the Zedge 24in 240 HZ 1ms monitor this is only $30 more expensive coming in at $140 and both these panels are around 24 in which is perfect for Competitive Gaming because contrary to popular belief small siiz panels allow you to see more at once which gives you better awareness in a game like fortnite the next piece of equipment that I'll be going over are mouse pads mouse pads tend to be heavily reliant on preference Some people prefer a super smooth Glide While others want something more rough and controlled what I can say however is that a mouse pad is not a thing that will hold you back from going pro as long as you have a decent mouse pad you'll still be able to compete at the highest level as for my recommendations if you want a more coarse and controlled feel to your mouse pad look no further than mouse pad company they have an array of mouse pads that are all super textured and give a super rough but controlled feeling to your aiming depending on the size they can range from anywhere from around $25 to $6 if you get a fulls siize deskmat if you just want to get the cheapest thing possible that's still decent quality there are plenty of options on Amazon for around 15 bucks however if you want to buy the best possible mouse pad I recommend the Artisan hind with soft hardness this mouse pad is absolutely perfect it has a smooth yet controlled Glide and I've had it for over a year without any signs of wear after using it for a while it began to get quite dirty but after a quick wash it was as good as new again with no signs of any wearing although it does cost $84 if you have the capital to spend on a mouse pad that will last you a very long time I highly recommend it the next thing you'll need for Competitive fortnite Gaming is the perfect headset unfortunately as far as headsets go you do need to spend a decent amount of money if you want to get something that's worth what you're paying for instead of paying $20 for headset that'll break in a couple months I think that the best headset are the hyperx cloud 2s although they are a little pricey coming in at around $80 new you can opt to buy them refurbish for a lower price and often times they're on sale as well these have top quality sound are comfortable to wear for long hours and come with a built-in microphone if that's a necessity if you don't like wired headphones you can choose to pay a little more for the wireless ones they're usually around $10 more expensive than the wired ones if you want to spend a little more you can get the hyperx cloud 3s which are the new improved versions of the ones I just talked about at the time I'm recording this they're all on sale on Amazon and you can get them for around $70 which is actually cheaper than the twos either way make sure you purchase a quality set of headphones because they help with Competitive Gaming more than people think now as far as chairs go obviously you could still go pro on your grandma's 6-year-old kitchen dining chair however for a lot of us we spend multiple hours a day in our chairs and therefore I think it's important to invest some money to a comfortable able and Healthy chair that way you aren't detri menting your future health by wasting away with horrid posture in a bad chair in my opinion gaming chairs are actually a waste of money while they look really cool and are often marketed to be good for long hours of gaming I think that office chairs are generally designed to be more ergonomic and comfortable for long hours of use as opposed to gaming chairs gaming chairs have to overcome the inherent problem of being a gaming chair to become a decent chair gaming chairs have to have a certain aesthetic that they need to fit and that's the first priority rather than the actual comfort of the user my budget recommendation for this is actually different than everything else to get a really universally comfortable chair it often costs north of $11,000 which is just completely out of most people's price range for a chair so what I would say the best and most budget friendly option is to look at Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist and see what you can buy used often times you can find chairs worth a lot of money for much much cheaper that way if you want to buy something new again rather than just buying something somewhat on the internet set is comfortable I think that the best way to get something good is to go to a store and try some stuff out in person this way you can feel a variety of chairs and feel which one supports the specific way you sit best I hope I helped you choose some products check these two

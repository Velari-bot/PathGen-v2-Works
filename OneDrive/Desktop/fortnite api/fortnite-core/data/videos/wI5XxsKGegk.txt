only four of the 65 fortnite players in this Lobby positioned themselves above this line this dead side of the zone is often hailed as the best position for pro players to put themselves in so why aren't any of them there well because it's not the best position in the zone for every team and a lot of people suck at rotating and this is actually where game winners eye drop and Mappy position themselves at this point in the game they clearly know what they're talking about since they won three of the six games and the overall tournament but in order to figure out why this position is actually so good we actually have to go back one zone to the fourth Zone where they position themselves on this hill roughly one third of the way into the safe Circle so what's good about this spot well it's a power position on the map with massive sight lines onto players rotating in the open Ice to their East it's also a cliff Edge that peers down into the jungle biome giving them great sight lines here it has a ton of fast harvesting brick that they can re-farm to ensure they have as many materials as possible after building their surge bases it has slight lines to the rift Island that spawns nearby AI allowing massive damage to be dealt to players attempting to capture the island and even a slurp plant nearby to regenerate Shield they lose when they're trading damage with nearby players yet none of these reasons are why this position is actually good the real reason is Zone priority this is a theory the export and it coach and now fncs broadcast producer mikkel told me about that I've now expanded on let's take a closer look at that position from eye drop and Mappy at the time they claimed it it was relatively close to the center of the third Zone and there are a large number of players to the south of them the fourth Zone in this game also pulls to the North First leaves them relatively close to the edge of that next Zone which means when these large cluster players to the South would eventually rotate up north of them they may potentially fight them but this also means that they can Farm These players for storm surge damage from a safe distance the congestion side is what we would call a low priority position all of these players have to wait for another player in front of them to rotate before they can actually start moving themselves so this area here would be all of the low priority area the high priority here would be the dead side and the center of the zone as these places often have the least players or the quickest rotates and the remainder is the medium priority area and as you see the position that I drop and Mappy put themselves in was a medium priority position and this is so that they could take advantage of all of the players in the low priority areas and rack up the storm surge damage on them reason they left this position so quickly was because the next Zone had already pulled and since they had their storm surge damage already they prioritized get themselves to a high priority area as this would give them the freest rotates and this is where you can form a fairly simple game plan high priority areas give you the freest rotates if you don't need storm surge damage as there's not going to be that many players around you to tag medium priority areas give you a reasonably free rotate however there's enough players around you to rack up storm surge damage and low priority areas suck now where things get interesting is the next Zone we're going to compare two teams Mappy and idrop who won the game against blur fire and Skrill who yeah they didn't the fit soon pulls yet again to the north agrov and Mappy use this Rift statue to try and fly his deep into the zone as possible to get to a high priority area unfortunately they're shot out of the sky and lose bunch of HP and are forced to land in a medium priority area since all of these zones are pulled to the north all of those players to the South are now fully stuck along the South edge of this Zone creating an insanely congested area the sixth zone now pulls to the East and they're able to use their slap splashes to give themselves Infinite Run energy and Sprint the entire rotation without being shot once but how with so many other teams in the area struggling to rotate since they're repeatedly being tagged and held by other teams how is it that I drop and Mappy can just run this so freely without being shot once especially from this unremarkable position that's nowhere near as good as the one they were in in the previous zone or so you might think take a look at this map when the sixth Zone pops you can see a ton of players are all stacked along the edge of the zone now since there's no held Mobility items like kinetic blades in order for this team to rotate to the next Zone the team in front of them has to move first and the team in front of them also has to move before them and so on and so forth has been over in the previous Zone this is the low priority position they have to wait for other players ahead of them to go before them and this is true almost irrespective of wherever this Zone would pull in this particular situation norexia and sisei are taking advantage of this by tagging every single team that along this congested side as they try to rotate and their focus is facing south but if you look at the map they are one of the only teams who would actually look at eye drop and Mappy as they rotated and they're focusing South giving eyedrop and Mappy that free rotate and the reason there's not that many other teams focusing them is because they're in a medium priority area hopefully you're starting to see why medium and high priority areas are so good for rotations because they were consistently in high or medium priority areas the only damage that I drop a Mappy took were while they were rifting through the sky so let's compare that to blurifier and Skrill who are constantly in a low priority area throughout the entire game if we go back a couple of zones we can see that they rotated very late into the fourth Zone and get hailed by Mr Savage and the deal in front of them because they have to rotate into them they end up boxing directly with them and get into an engagement which wastes more time make a good play to get ahead but now they have teams holding them from the front and Mr Savage and the deal behind them so on this fifth Zone rotate they are in a low priority position as there's tons of teams in front of them who can hold them from here over the seven teams along the edge of the Zone here it shouldn't surprise you that none of them made it into a single digit placement in this game to counteract this bad position they go to loot Island to gather extra heals but when they pad to rotate they are held by even more teams in the low priority area the lucky six Zone pool they try to make a good rotate but are 400 below the storm surge threshold and die fighting a team on the edge and this is actually another massive issue with the low priority areas because you're constantly being pressured and focused by teams in the medium priority area and also around you in the low priority areas there's not as much chance for you to be able to actually deal damage back to other players because you're the one who's getting shot at shouldn't surprise you that the team that spent all of their game in high and medium priority areas is almost 900 above the storm surge damage threshold whereas blur fire and Skrill were 400 below but of course the main question I asked in this video was why are none of the players in the dead side of the Zone what we now know is a high priority area well the two teams who are here are seti and Kami and Paco and yamko and they're here because they are above the storm surge threshold so they could move into this area without having to worry about getting more tags everyone else in the lobby either needed more storm surge damage so didn't position themselves further into the zone or the rotates sucked these zones were relatively simple they all just pulled up to the north so it's easy to figure out the majority players are going to be on the south rotating from far pois and fairly simple to understand where the high and medium priority areas are what about a more complicated game in this game the first Zone pulls to the southeast and then the second Zone does exactly the same thing so if you understand how to read zones you'd probably predict that the third Zone would also pull down to the southeast however it does the complete opposite and pulls back to Northwest the result of this is out of the 76 players 22 of them are below this line and the other 54 are above it so this does create a dead side versus congested side interestingly the 4 fourth Zone doesn't move that much as it's relatively Central now this allows more players to evenly spread themselves out but there is still less players in this bottom half and in the fifth Zone yet again pulls Central the result of this is that the majority of players are all around the edge of the previous Zone and what we know is a low priority area now remember because this zone is more Central and it has had a couple pullbacks there's not necessarily a fully established deadside in this particular fifth zone so that would mean that the priority areas look a lot more like this so as I mentioned there's a lot of players surrounding the entire outside of the Zone in the low priority areas let's take a deep dive into how one of the teams got there which is Nipsey and Archie I know what you're thinking I also didn't think this video would turn into an archive odd review But Here we are now they already start at a disadvantage and no not because it's Archie they're Landing in Breakwater Bay and as you already know the first two zones pull to the southeast being max distance for lamb based on their drop spot this means that in order for them to get to a high priority area they would have to leave this drop spot incredibly early sacrificing some of the loot and materials that you could potentially get here they end up leaving here relatively late and end up on the low priority Zone in the first Zone and then yet again the same thing on the second Zone at the time that the third Zone appears this is when their combat cash spawns and ends up going to the north east of them they rotate over here but ultimately can't get their cash and end up high on top of a tower tagging other people for search because they stay here for too long at the edge of the Zone they make a massive mistake they actually let giras and Chari get in front of them allowing them to look back and farm Archer Nipsey for surge the ideal situation here is that Nipsey and Archie get ahead of giras and Chari and if they continue to rotate early they can keep farming the same team on every single rotate because they constantly have Zone priority ahead of them however because they let them get ahead they became victim to this exact strategy now they do manage to pull a lucky fourth Zone that's right on top of them but they still just get farmed by all their teams in front and you can probably guess what happens onto the fifth Zone as well because they're in a low priority position they then get stuck in another low pair position in that zone so as you can see it's very difficult to break the loop if you get into a low priority position early it's very difficult to get into a medium or high priority position because low priority teams will wait for medium priority teams to move medium priority teams away for high priority teams to move there will always be a queuing system like this and if you fall behind it's very hard to catch up however if you're early enough and you get into a higher medium priority position in the second or third Zone you can constantly stay ahead in these positions so hopefully that shows you how important it is to ensure that you get into a high or medium priority position early in the game but so far we've only covered zones one through to five and there's still seven more which have completely different Zone priority mechanics since zones 6 7 and 8 are all partial zones that handy dead side map that we had earlier will start to look very familiar now in this sixth Zone rotation you have the lucky teams who've managed to pull the Zone but the first teams to rotate in are unsurprisingly the teams who are in high priority positions such as Akira and Skyjack who you'll probably remember from one of my previous videos tuna and dandir and then pings and Kyrie you'll see that as the medium and lower priority teams end up rotating into the Zone it's a very similar story to the first example that we talked about a lot of congestion around the edge in the low priority areas some congestion in the medium priority areas with the teams who have rotated a little bit deeper into the Zone than the higher priority areas are the full dead side and in the center of the zone and this exact same cycle repeats for the next two partial zones the thing that differentiates zone 6 7 and 8 from the earlier zones is that the high priority zones here are infinitely more important because the players are now so clustered together that it's almost impossible to rotate and if you are successful you'll probably waste a ton of heels and materials here so getting onto the dead side and in the high priority zones in the sixth sevens and eight zones is one of the most beneficial things you can do for your rotations I mean look at the sixth Zone in this game the only team here is Kami in seti and when the Zone pulls to the southeast obviously came in City pull the Zone but if you look at a team who's had a completely Max distance pool which is Cherry and giras they have a free rotation throughout this Complete deadside because there is no one stopping them contrast that to Akira and sky jump who ended up positioning here in the low priority Zone and assumed that the seventh Zone pulled max distance for them to the West before they could even rotate almost the entire Lobby would have to move first so if you put yourself in a low priority area in the 6th 7th or eighth zones the parcel zones you're just hoping that you're going to pull a good Zone however if you put yourself in a high priority area you have significantly more rotation options depending on wherever the Zone pulls and that's where the next strategy Lobby manipulation comes into play Let's Take a closer look at Cami and seti's rotation this game in the fit Zone they were in a medium priority area but obviously locked out pulling the sixth Zone since they're smart they took advantage of this good RNG and used this as an opportunity to get themselves to the dead side of the zone and into a high priority position with rotate it down to the South now because these are partial zones that means that this area here and this area here what I'd call temporary zones and a lot of players use this to their advantage by getting onto the dead side through this area that they know no players are going to be in but as always there's going to be a counter to every single strategy and unsurprisingly that's going to be Zone priority if you're one of the first people to rotate like Camion City they position themselves ahead of where these players would rotate into this allows them to hold any players trying to rotate through this area and you will block them from being able to get to the dead side and the high priority areas and force them into a low priority position so now they're the only team on this side of the Zone meaning wherever the Zone pools they have the most options for wherever they want to rotate but Zone priority isn't everything in the first game that we looked at camian city were in a high priority Zone and very quickly died afterwards in this match that we saw Archie and Nipsey repeatedly be in the low priority zones it was actually their best game you can still mess up a good position or you can fight your way out of a bad position or it's fortnite so RNG also will play a factor but building a strategy that revolves around being in medium or high pressure priority areas will undoubtedly get you to end game the most consistently and not understood a single thing about this entire video and you want the easiest takeaway that you can apply to every single tournament just stay away from the very edge of the zone and try to rotate a little bit deeper into the safe Circle than you probably are already

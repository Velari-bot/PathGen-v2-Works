in this video I'm going to be covering 10 build moves that you need to learn these are things that I've seen Pros do repeatedly in their gameplay and they're things I feel like anyone can learn and should learn if you want to win more fights in ranked scrims or tournaments before I start with the first move if you enjoy these videos make sure to like And subscribe and also support a Creator users get reset at the beginning of every month and we had 200 in February so now I really want to try to beat that and get even more in March so if you wouldn't mind using Code doll FN I'd really really appreciate it the first move I want to go over is the protected side jump this move is really simple and easy to chain together together with other builds that you do the main benefit of it is that it's extremely protected and you can't get shot from any angle all right so for the protected side jump what you want to do is you want to be on a ramp like this with the floor above your head you want to edit through the floor so you can place walls through this cone if the floor is here the wall will just Place below so you need to edit through the floor and then you can place walls and then you want to jump out and land on a ramp facing the same direction as this ramp and then Place Another cone above your head that's the basic idea of it but realistically you want a wall here too so when you jump out you want to look backwards and place those walls and then look forward place the ramp and Cone and then you can chain it together so now there's really no angle that I can get shot from and it's really easy to either keep chaining together with itself or you can go into other retakes as well the next move is the high wall side jump instead of just trying to ascend layers protectively the main idea of the high wall side jump is you're trying to get piece on your opponent so you can use the piece to either go for a shot or simply just get a cone and then get to High Ground so for the high wall side jump you want to start on a ramp and Cone again but instead of placing a wall or jumping up and doing a side jump like that what you want to do is you want to look back at the cone and place two walls as you jump up as soon as you have these two walls up you want to jump again and place a wall and ramp like this and now if they're standing on a ramp up there you can either go for a cone and a piece or you can just go for a cone and then 90 up yourself or if they're not on their ramp and they're on a ramp one higher up what you can do is you can tack Sprint jump up again and go for the wall and get a cone and then from there you can either go for a shot or you can just go up again so in full speed that looks like this the next move is the reverse cone retake this move is a little hard to execute but the point is to try and get your opponent to step up onto your cone that you can piece them up and go for a shot if you don't get the piece though it's not a momentum stopper so you can keep going up as well so for this one it starts when you're scissor ramping with a ramp above your head like this then once you get a ramp on the bottom that's one further out on the ramp on top you want to run up onto it and turn around and place a ramp and Cone like this once you have this ramp and Cone you can edit up the cone like this once you have the cone edited up like this you can place four walls and two ramps like this immediately now with this wall you can edit through it and go for a cone on this ramp that hopefully your opponent's walked up and if they have walked up it you can fully box it and then go for a shot on it or you can piece them and start going up from there or another thing you can do is you can just if you don't catch anyone you can just edit straight through it and it won't stop your momentum at all you can also cone it through a window like that and overall it's just a super versatile move here's what it looks like in full speed the next move is kind of a combination of two moves that I would like to call protected 90s you can use this move to go up layers without losing your momentum while staying completely protected it's mechanically a little hard to pull off but with some practice I think that anyone can do it so this next move is a little more complicated and it's starts with a ramp and a floor and Cone above your head you're going to do the double tile edit like this and then place the ramp floor and ramp where this differs however is after you edit through this floor you want to place the walls and The Cone Above This ramp as well as a wall behind you here and then you want to jump and edit this ramp at the same time almost as if you're doing a 90 then you want to place a wall through this cone and edit one tile of it and then place a cone above the other cone and then you want to reset edit the cone and then from here you can either go up like that or you can just keep chaining it together here's what that looks like in full speed this move is a ramp rush you can use when someone is sitting above you spraying this is a good move because there are a lot of variations of it so that you can adapt depending on what gun they're using when they're reloading and things like that so for this one we're going to pretend someone up there is spraying us and we want to get up there what you want to do is you want to have two ramps like this as well as cones over both of the ramps and then you want to Alternate which ramp you're walking on every time you edit through one so say I edit through this wall and Cone I start walking up this ramp and then I place two walls like this and then place two ramps out like this and then immediately block the sight line with walls again as soon as I edit through this one again I'm going to immediately place a cone so that I can't get sprayed and then I'm going to walk out this side and do it again if you're getting hard sprayed it's also recommended you use hard mats and then double layer instead of just single airing here's what A variation of it looks like in full speed the next move is a reverse triple edit reverse triple edits are good because they aren't a usual build sequence so the sudden change in Direction can take a lot of people off guard and let you get pce or High Ground the reverse triple edit is super simple you can do it anytime you're just under a flooring cone instead of just editing through it like this like you would normally what you want to do is you want to edit the back two tiles edit a wall like this and then jump up and land on a ramp you want to make sure that as you turn around you're not losing your momentum instead of stopping turning around and jumping you want to make sure that you're doing a circular motion with your movement and then this move is really good for chaining it together with other retakes if you don't get the piece it's really easy to just go straight into something else here's what it looks like in full speed the next move is the clicks 90 one of the biggest disadvantages of 90s is that while they're very efficient in taking you upwards you can't go in a direction while you ascend the clicks 90 allows you to ascend layers at the same rate while also going towards or away from someone which is a huge Advantage it's also super mechanically easy to pull off and anyone can do it so for a click 90 you want to just start off on a ramp like this and then it's super simple all you do is place two ramps like this one forward and out and then one to the left of that one and then from around the middle of this ramp you want to jump up and place a floor and ramp that you land on facing that way and then as you run a little bit more than halfway up this ramp you want to go diagonally and jump up onto a floor and ramp on top of this one and then you can easily chain it together just like this and then you can even add in TCT sprinting to make it even faster with jump fatigue you could only do it a couple times in a row so the best thing to do is to chain it with jumpless 90s like this and you you guys already saw what it looks like in full speed so I'm not going to make you guys watch it again this move is something people have been doing forever but now you can abuse the fact that you can tax print and edit the same time to make it good and relevant again it's a simple protected retake that anyone can do that you turn into a direction change to take them off guard so to do this move you want to do that same double tile edit and then do a ramp floor ramp and edit through it but instead of just editing through this normally you want to start your tax print now and you want to edit through the floor reset it and then edit the ramp back all will continue to tax print this is possible because now you can tax Sprint and edit at the same time so this move takes advantage of that so that you can go up layers super fast it chains into other moves really well and you change directions really fast so it's really unexpected and it catches people off guard a ton here's what it looks like in full speed the next move is just a thwi cone side jump this is a classic move that you can do anytime you're ramping up because it's a fast and protected way to ascend layers quickly it's been around forever because of how simple yet effective it is so when you're ramping up I'm sure you've seen a tho cone before it's when you place these walls these four walls behind you and a cone on top of it but to do the side jump after you do that you should jump do it and then land on a floor and ramp and then place two walls through the cone like this and then side jump again from here you can just do a 90 or you can continue to retake here's what it looks like in full speed the final move is a ramp box when you throw your ramps out often times you can get a ramp over your opponent's head and then go for a piece or shot this move is really nice because if you don't catch them you can keep going and if you do catch them it's super versatile and you can go for a ton of different shots so to do this final move anytime you're retaking or 90 you kind of want to just try and throw your ramps out if you think you can get it over their heads so when I'm 9 it would look something like that or that and then if I'm retaking it could look something like that and so now if if you realize that you've gotten your ramp over someone's head you can do this build sequence you want to place a wall here edit through it and then place a floor and two walls to get them boxed in from here you have a ton of options but this isn't a great right hand so what you can do is you can flip the ramp like this and then edit to go for a right hand with this wall or you could just window edit this and go for a right hand Peak like this another one you could do is you could walk onto the ramp and edit like this and go for a right hand like that or since they're fully boxed in you could even go all the way around to the back and go for a window edit like that and if they're not in it it doesn't even stop your momentum you could just edit straight through it here's what it looks like in full speed if you have the game open do me a favor and put code doll FN into the item shop thank you for watching no long as bye

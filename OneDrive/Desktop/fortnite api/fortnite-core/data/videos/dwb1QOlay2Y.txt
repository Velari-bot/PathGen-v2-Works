winning more fights in fortnite is actually way simpler than you may think and it doesn't just depend on having super fast and flashy mechanics in this video I'm going to share with you some new fighting moves and mechanics updated for chapter 6 that you can learn which Pros use on a daily basis to help them win more fights quickly if you do find this video helpful please do drop a like And subscribe for more content just like this okay so starting off with basic with the three main Peaks that you should be using first up we have the simple window edit now notice that the mindle window edit is actually larger than the side window edit so when making a window edit Peak onto your opponent you always want to make sure you use a side window edit and try and right and Peak them like so next up we have the generic peanut butter Peak now this is like this and you can look to right and Peak them just by jumping up over opponent like this and getting a free shot onto your opponent now the last and third main Peak which you should use is this diagonal wall Peak right here because it allows you to position to the left hand side of your box and still get a nice easy pump onto your opponent whereas from your opponent's point of view you are concealed mostly especially your head by the so they can't get as high damage of a shot onto you I would only make this peak when you have the Health Advantage over the opponent there are other more advanced peaks in the game which you can use like the martos peak or like this peak right here these aren't really practical for in-game use so now moving on to part two this is the most commonly misplayed scenario in fortnite and it's where you have both the floor and the cone on your opponent when they are below you in the box now what people do is they often have the floor in the cone they edit it tole and then they drop down into the box of the opponent and try and pick off the kill this way but this is a massive misplay as by dropping down you end up getting a 50/50 into your opponent so I'm going to show you two ways which you can play this to avoid taking a 50/50 so the first way you can play this scenario when you have the floor and The Cone is by simply editing the floor and The Cone and pretend you have the piece you want to edit the corner of the cone up like so and then edit three tiles of the floor right here and this allows you to get a nice Peak on your opponent who might be in the back of the box right there and then you can get a nice protected Peak onto them because if you drop down it's actually really hard to get an anger onto your opponent right here because if you shoot you're just going to pump the floor instead of pumping the opponent's head now you can do the second way of this is and that's by editing the floor and The Cone like so and if you notice that the opponent has nothing in their box when you edit in then you want to place ramp in their box and edit this ramp diagonally now what this will do is this will push your opponent into this corner right here and if you position over to the left hand side you can get a nice right hand Peak onto your opponent which from their perspective it's really or almost impossible to see you as again if they try and pump you even with their reticle on you they're just going to end up pumping the St part three of today's video is about how to properly approach an opponent when they are sat in a box like this now there are two main ways that you can do this and the first and most common mistake which IP people make is walk up and just straight double pickaxe the wall like this this is way too predictable and the second your opponent sees you swinging their pickaxe they're just going to make a wide edit open and pump you in the face so what you can actually try and do is you can single swing your pickaxe and then pull out your shotgun straight away like so so let's pretend we was walking up to the wall we single pull out our pickaxe and then aim your shotgun at the opponent what they may do inside the box is they may make this open edit and what you will do is you've already got your pump reticle on them so you can get an easy Max damage pump onto the opponent like so however something to keep in mind when trying to pickax Bay is that there's this new move coming really popular with players and what that is is basically when you swing up to the wall and you've pickaxed it once and then you hold their shotgun out what the opponent Inside the Box may do is they may actually open a window at it leaving themselves exposed to a shot from you and the reason why they do this is because you then take a shot of the wall and that encourages you to try and hit them because obviously you're taking a shot to try and hit them but what they do is they basically reset the wall really fast so what you do is you end up shooting out their wall and getting no damage onto the opponent then what this does is this leaves the opponent in the box with a free shot onto you which they can then take and then looks piece you up like so so okay but what actually is the correct way to approach and pressure a player in a box well you always want to make sure that you set up diagonally now my favorite way to do this is When approaching your opponent in a box place a cone down right in front of them and edit the top two tiles up just like a ramp like so then you want to make sure you either claim one of the two sidewalls claim both of their available but make sure you claim at least one because what you can then do is edit out the side of this sidewalk and look to reset this cone immediately which already leaves you a right hand Peak on the opponent if they were to example have this edit open now it's not only this that you guys can do so when you've got the cone and you flipped out and you've come out to the side what you can then do is set up a box right here because from this diagonal box you can see there there and I'm here so we're playing diagonally you can pressure on this right hand side right here you can pressure there W look to claim this wall and get an edit onto them or you can set up another right hand Peak on the opponent right here so you can either right and Peak with this wall or you can right hand Peak with this wall now the advantage to this wall of course like we showed is the right hand Peak but the advantage to this one again is that say your opponent has an open edit just like so you can actually see through and pump them as you guys can see I can shoot through here if I'm use my pump shotgun but when you go to the other side and you look from their prv they cannot pump you all they end up doing is pumping out your wall so when you are in this situation in this box you have a free right and Peak onto them and they cannot get an angle onto you so both of these Peaks when setting up diagonally are really really advantageous and you can use both of them when trying to pressure and fight an opponent who's boxed up so next up for part four of today's video I want to talk about how to deal with and how to pressure opponents when they're playing defensively in a box like so now something to not is that around 80% of players when their wool is being pressured like so actually always edit out to their left hand side in instead of their right hand side now you can note this obviously that they're more likely to edit out to this side and you could look to prep piece just out to the right hand side like so but now talking about just how you're going to pressure the opponent in general when you are looking and coming up and when they're playing defensively like this which pretty straightforward what you need to do you just need to decrease the amount of potential options they have when exiting their bxs and this can be for using exit piece or something like that so for example if I put a box out to the left hand side while they're in this box he now no longer has the option of going going out to his right hand side which of course is my left so I know that decreases the amount of options that he can do then that means there's an even more likely chance that he runs out to his right hand side right here which again we can look to piece control up if I have boxes on both sides and a cone in front this significantly decreases the amount of options which the player Inside the Box can do so if you get their wall like so there's now nowhere they can go and you can use a good smart Peak like the peanut butter and pick up the elimination so now moving on to part number five I want to talk about learning to use phasins to end fights quicker now the code of the map I'm using is at the top of the screen and it's really good because it allows you to practice running and phasing in now running and phasing in is not easy you have to try and time your shot correctly so that you can get into the box and then get a free shot onto your opponent if they was in the Box this map has a bunch of different ones which you can use ranging through for example infinite phasing through the floor so what you got to do is you got to jump and then time your shot correctly so you phase right through onto the opponent and get a free shot onto them and you can again just continually practice this and it's quite hard to learn I recommend spending quite a long time in it and incorporating this into your warm-up routine again the code is at the top you also want to try and learn to do this with a pickaxe but this is a lot harder to do as you can see I reckon I can do it about 50% of the time and what it allows you to do is when you get your opponent weak you can literally just run and jump straight through the wall and then get an instant shot onto your opponent helping you to uh finish the fight quicker the codes right there there's the name of the map I'd recommend you implemen this into your routine if you found

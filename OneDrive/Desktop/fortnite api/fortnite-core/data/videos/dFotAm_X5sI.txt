hey guys welcome back to another YouTube video and in this video we're going to be talking about five Advanced Pro tips that igles can use this one's not gonna be edited that much I'm just going to be doing a verbal lesson so you can just follow along you just have to listen and watch the notes on screen that I'll be writing right here sorry about the dark camera as usual uh this will be fixed in due time but let's talk about Duos right there's not that much to really talk about in general uh prior to telling you the five tips but I did want to point out one thing I did want to point out this important detail which is the fact that there's two main setups in Duos right it's very simple the first one is the igl slash Fragger setup this is the like most commonly heard but not necessarily the most commonly executed so I'll explain what I mean by that but the second one is actually like having a tarp lead and then an observer so someone who like calls out things that they see information um or a follower right and they just copycat like you can even write copycat here right and that's sort of how I think about it at least um this is actually more common in Duos Believe It or Not although there are setups with pro teams and other amateur teams where people have a hard igl and the other guy is just like doesn't make calls at all right only one person makes a call now I personally believe that this is a better setup just because having two sets of eyes making calls and having both people know the game sense so that they can both make calls is a very important aspect of your Duo so if you are at this sort of setup where your fragger's not making calls at all I would at least you know potentially let them make a couple calls even if it's an 80 20 split or something that sort understand that they should be able to make calls too as long as they're good calls right of course they should be capable of making good calls before they sort of transition into this setup but that's okay uh this just is letting you guys know that there's different setups here right uh personally really important aspect this can flip between players right this setup right here what I mean by that let's say you have like your player one and player two and you guys are moving forward like this right and that zone pulls back but not exactly back into your target at an angle now this player like if you want to rush for it right you want to get the head of Zone and really make sure your front arm this player will now become tarply right the rules switch and then this person becomes Observer follower this person is more than capable of harping because a good Duo should be capable of doing everything and then they move like this I want your Duo to have that flexibility where you can become this setup right here and highlight it so let's just move on I just wanted to give you guys a sort of brief on this sort of thing uh because people don't really necessarily understand that this video could actually apply for both people in your Duo you understand because if you're doing this the calls can come from both players and it's very important to understand that you can actually use all these tips for both players and you're doing that's just something that I wanted to point out so let's get into it right five Advanced tips for igles pretty simple first thing very simple but actually really important it sounds not that advanced but I really want you to understand the impact that this tip has on your gameplay and it's as simple as make it as easy as possible or your teammate to follow you understand right so when I say follow I don't necessarily just mean physically although that's an aspect of it right when I say physically I mean tarps right I mean the rotates that you do make it as easy as possible for your teammate to follow that is one aspect of it that's actually the more obvious ones right but what about communication the choice of words that you use uh can be difficult to follow you understand so a really clear example of this is instead of just saying follow me come follow me you can tell them exactly what you're finding to do ahead of time right so that the communication is very much easier to follow instead of just saying come here or go left right go left is better than come here you understand and sometimes they don't even know where you are so come here is very vague and there's examples of this right this is just very simple examples but there's more examples past this where you should particularly be careful with the words you choose because they're not easy to follow when you listen to them you understand so it's very important to particularly like actually body review your comps like record your games and body viewer comms because sometimes you could be making Communications that is very very difficult to follow um and the other player could be doing the same and this is something that we need to smooth out and make sure that we're doing well otherwise it's going to be very difficult to actually play the game as a team and we know obviously that that's an important part of the duo playing as a team next thing if you're you're the hard idea let's say you have this sort of setup right and you're making 90 of the calls you best believe you better understand the game right like actually understanding the game right and so in other words you should be the one right putting the most amount of time in the game macro ice what do I mean by that right macro wise I'll give you some examples so you'll understand through examples what I mean by that because in other words if you have ninety percent of the say or 95 percent of say or even 100 of a say in terms of calls they better be good calls right you like your whole team's relying on this right and sometimes it's Trio sometimes it's Duos but any in any case right your team's relying on this so you better make the right call in other words macro what do I mean by macro surge positioning is macro right circled one to five rotates is macro right layering in end game is macro very important macro actually because if you position yourself wrong in end game maybe you're too high and you get sprayed by hey there's just stuff like that as well uh win conditions right win conditions in in end game sometimes it goes up a hill like what's your win condition there yeah you got to get up right and actually understanding that you know positioning in the prior Zone because there's a potential for it to pull up a hill is an also important detail that you should take into account um another thing is I'll spawn strategy right just you're most likely going to be discussing and telling your teammate what to do in this sort of setup you're usually the smarter player right and that's why you should be very very refined in all of these things otherwise your team will fail in this case okay so it's very important to get this right okay third tip in other words what I'm really saying here in the second tip actually is put more time into voter views than you usually do obviously you should be good microwise as well your mechanics aim and sort of Peaks edits all these things would be good obviously but it's important to understand that these these details are actually what get you through Heats and into Grand finals for example this is this becomes more important than that sort of environment um so get this right okay third tip talk Less in general because a lot of proteins actually do this because sometimes you're saying stuff that could be clogging up comms or clogging up audio so that your teammate can't hear important edits or pickaxes that on your wall or you know footsteps for example so only say what's important right and actually if you talk too much it sort of clouds the things that are important in other words um sometimes if you're just constantly talking talking talking talking the important detail becomes sort of saturated right it becomes sort of left in the details um and it's really important to only talk when you need to and only talk about important details okay um another sort of way you can think about this is you know how sometimes people scream they talk about like urgency in your voice if you're if you're constantly enthusiastic about you know what's going on uh and you're constantly screaming you're constantly yelling you're constantly like come here come here come here right and it's very important to understand that that doesn't do you any good your Duo is not benefiting from that and it's important to only use that urgent voice calm or urgent style when it's actually important like in my box for example as a comp if you use that in every scenario I think that would not be good for you I understand so try to avoid sort of just putting urgency in every part of your game right so talk less and only put urgency in urgent situations right this is important and then in other words right like the important situations like for example an enemy in your box stand out in this way right if you constantly talk talk talk talk talk talk come here come here follow me left right left right like it's gonna be difficult it's gonna be very difficult for your teammate to actually follow you which goes back to you know this this one this tip right here you have to get this right okay so tip number four let's talk about tip number four very important actually this one's difficult but important to understand pre-planning I talk about pre-planning a lot uh and it's for good reason it's important right tell your teammates what you're about to do before you do it and some other scenarios is talk about potential plans that can happen uh if x happens for example I'll give you some examples okay because this is actually pretty important I want you guys to understand this examples is the best way to sort of explain this so good example is let's say you're waiting you get into static Zone in other words the end zone of a moving Zone the end zone the white circle of a moving Zone you're waiting right you're waiting for the next moving to show while you're waiting because you have nothing else to do there's no clear impact opportunities near you and you're just waiting you're waiting like full in a metal box you're just waiting with your teammate you tell your teammate if it pulls double pull forward we're gonna take low ground okay that's very clear if it pulls West we have to go up right and even that actually is not even that important because if we have to go up that's more on you you understand that one's more on you because you're the tarper if you're tarping you don't need to tell your teammate you have to go up you just do it right you could tell them it could help but actually the more important calm is the one for low ground because what you're essentially telling your teammate is like if it pulls double pull forward when I say double pull forward all I mean is the moving Zone pulls in the same direction as the previous moving Zone we're going to take low ground right and why is that a good play because dead side is the double pull forward direction right so if it double pulls forward front side is dead side which means there's a lot of empty space on low ground that you can just drop down and cut in front of previous low ground and place ramps and walls and then take Logan for yourself you understand this is why it's important because it's a very timely action if you don't do this right then and there the opportunity is gone and you won't have low ground low ground's a win condition right that's what win conditions earlier it's a win condition to make sure that you get top two in your game guaranteed as long as you hold it properly pretty pretty simple example but actually really important uh you know this could also happen for height right height opportunities like in half off you tell your teammate like we may go for height just be ready for it right you're telling your teammate to be prepared for the call so that when the Call Comes they're not surprised they know exactly what to do you understand so this could be a good opportunity as well for you to clean up your gameplay and make sure you're pre-planning telling your teammate to be on the same page okay last thing very important this is actually probably the most important tip that I could offer you guys honestly is to be decisive right really important uh if you can't be decisive it's going to be very very very very very difficult to do well in this meta honestly SMG spray makes things way more fast-paced than possible it's often better right this is the detail that I really want you to understand okay understand that making the third or fourth best decision in any given situation with confidence here right in any given situation is often better than making the best possible play with self-dial okay now this is something that a lot of people don't understand people think fortnite is chess people think that if you make the wrong move you're dead this is not necessarily true uh actually it's more about how you execute certain plans right than it is about you know because you see people landing on height when it makes no sense to land on height you see people doing stuff that you've never seen before and these are pro teams dude it's just they're confident about the play they execute on it and they're very convinced that this is the right plan right so oftentimes it's better to make a decision in a lower amount of time especially in end game than it is to wait hesitate get yourself killed and they'll be like oh I know what to do now right not no point no point not not at all and oftentimes staying ahead and staying like you know front side is an important detail in Duos and it's important to understand that if you hesitate there you could lose it for example on low ground it's very important sometimes you tank storm for this to stay ahead to prevent other people from dropping down in front of you and taking low ground from themselves right if you hesitate on that it's over it's very important to like constantly say hey constantly say ahead especially in a very stocked end game uh that becomes even more important okay so really get this point because this is probably the most important tip in this video seriously very important detail okay because if you get this part right I think you'll be a very good idea even if you ignore everything else although I do recommend learn all of these right so let's review very simply make it as easy as possible for your teammates to follow both physically and communicatively the choice of words and your tarp and your rotates in general actually understand the game right study the game make it an art where you learn every little detail and especially actually it's not about every you know small detail because if you learn everything some things that don't matter as much as the others right so learn the stuff that matters uh watch Pros because that's the best way to do it talk lesson only put urgency in urgent situations and then this way the most important situations stand out this way because if you're constantly screaming and then you scream in my box it doesn't stand out as much it doesn't click make sense so really make sure that it clicks it stands out pre-planning make sure you tell your teammates what you're about to do before you actually do it so they're prepared so they know what to do and also like we're about to rotate it's better than I'm rotating comp right because if you do I'm rotating come and you run Full Speed Ahead there's a bigger gap between you and your teammate now whereas if you you're holding get it you're just waiting and you say are you ready we're about to leave and then he's like okay yeah and then makes sense instead of doing I'm leaving and then he reacts and then there's a big gap that way so just make sure your teammate's always with you that way right so pre-planning does for you so final tip the most important one is to be decisive and make sure you understand that it's not always about the best play even though you have to try your best to get to that point it's often about doing the subplotter play with confidence and making sure that you're confident when you're doing it and your execution often matters more than the plan itself thank you for watching this video and I'll see you guys next time peace

my name is ken i'm gonna teach you how to play single claw double claw triple claw whatever claw you need for any type of controller ps4 ps5 xbox and i got it all in this video if you have a controller that i didn't mention this applies to every type of controller one thing that separates this video from other videos is that it's going to be very organized there's going to be timestamps in this video just look at the playhead of the video itself and you can see exactly where you want to jump to or what you want to look at good youtuber campaigns here i'd seriously recommend watching this whole thing through i'm not going to waste any of your time we're going to talk about benefits of claw things to note how to have a stronger grip after thoughts and final tips and tricks common mistakes as well as the sensitivity got some quick pointers that i wish someone told me about when i first started here's a quick little disclaimer for you guys i'm going to show it on this mousepad cam so if we switch over the one thing that i want to mention is that when people say you play claw and it causes all these wrist problems and hand problems and blah blah i don't necessarily agree with all that because you can play claw in a loose grip so it doesn't cause too much tension in your hand what i recommend you to never do is to have this tight claw grip that you see here you see how i tense up my hands like really tight and then i go crazy and try and press all these buttons like this in this video i'm going to show you a cam just like this where i show you exactly how to have a loose grip and not have any claw problems or wrist problems or whatever everyone's body and hands do things differently though so if you have really bad problems with your hands at the start and you really feel uncomfortable with it then don't force it let's get into the main portion of the video first time stamp the benefits of claw plain and simple this is why you want to switch the claw pros that do not use paddles use claw and this is why you're never going to take your hands off the analog 6 which will lead to better movement and better aim across the board one of the easiest ways to demonstrate this is when you shoot and jump and build while you're in the air you will be able to aim shoot and then build while turning and do that all in the air because of claw if you were to do this without claw your movement would look very rigid and stiff and that's how i could tell a claw player from a non-claw player just an fyi there are ways around this if you bind your jump to an analog stick but even then your binds won't be nearly as optimal as if you played claw claw is one of those things where it's harder in the beginning but it's way more rewarding in the end so the benefit of that is that you're going to be able to kill a lot of people i just want to let you guys know i used to play claw but now i use paddles i'm very familiar with tips and tricks in here i wouldn't be making this video if i was lying to you in any way so you got to kind of take my word that i know how to play claw on here i'm definitely not a master but i know how i could teach someone i'm on pc this is an xbox one elite series 2 controller and here are my settings that i use right now i don't use any boost and i do play on linear if you're looking to play claw in here here's how i would do it when you're on an xbox controller what i would recommend is to only do right hand claw so when you start out all you want to do is you want to stick your finger out just like this i know it's looking kind of stupid when you rest your finger here you put your hand in and then you just twist in a little bit so you want to make sure that you have a little curvature to your wrist right along here like you see here look i've come in i go like this and then i just twist in just a little bit for me i found the most effective way to press all the face buttons was to turn my wrist in a little bit so i have a better angle to do so if i were to play call on the left side it would look like the same thing so all i'm doing is i'm coming in resting here i'm going to rest my finger on this d-pad because that's where i'm going to be doing most of the like the actions over here i turn my hand in and i would use this to move around and i would use this for the d-pad just look at my backhand though these fingers right here these are gonna be in charge of supporting the controller and then this middle finger right here is gonna be the only button that's in charge of pressing lv and lt so the same thing would apply on the right side and just remember that your middle finger is the only finger that's in charge of pressing the triggers never ever play claw and then reach over here to press rb or even lb on the left hand if you play double claw and xbox you're literally a madman because you have to move your left analog stick with your index finger i think someone told me that leche does this and i don't even know how that's even possible this is the most uncomfortable weirdest thing i've ever seen in my life you could try it out for yourself i'm not discouraging you if anything i'm encouraging you because there are some pros that do that as well i don't have any settings to show you for the ps4 and ps5 portion of this video that's just a quick fyi i mostly play on this xbox one elite series two controller i do have a how to find your sensitivity and controller video linked in the description okay so next up we have this ps4 controller here it's actually a scuff controller with two paddles but i'm not gonna be using that for the sake of the video i'm just gonna be doing a normal claw grip okay so we got the controller perfectly in view just like this what we're gonna do is you're gonna put it in your left hand any position you want it doesn't matter from here you're gonna start out with your right hand just like this with your pointer finger out all you're gonna do is rest it on this completely flat notice how my hand is is literally it's not like this it's like this and then i just wrap my hand around it like this but make sure once you rest it right so it's flat and then i put it here once i get to this position right here all i want to do is twist my hand just a little bit and then apply a decent amount of pressure at the same time on the bottom of your wrist like this so you're gonna have a tight grip at the bottom you're gonna put it on just like this and then you're gonna twist in just a little bit and then from there what you're gonna do is right see those two fingers how they're holding the controller just like that so once again we're gonna come in like this we're gonna fit it on our bottom two hand our bottom two fingers just like this and then we're gonna put it really tight in between our palm not so tight where you're just gonna shake and squeeze and break the thing but you rest rested here and then now this middle finger right here is in charge of pressing the two triggers right here just notice how my pointer finger is moving as i'm pressing these triggers that's normal so from here on the left side it's the same thing we're gonna come in just like this rest it somewhere wherever wherever you want it doesn't matter and then you put pressure here and then you just come here and then you can turn in just a little bit as well turn your wrist in just like that so both are turned in and then now you can press the triggers with your middle fingers and then your pointer fingers are in charge of pressing all these face buttons notice how my thumbs will never come off the analog 6 ever ever ever never take your hands off the analog 6 when you're playing claw that's not the right way to do it the ps5 controller is a little bit more difficult but one thing i want to tell you real quickly is that you might need some bigger hands to use double claw in this thing but let's get started okay so next up in this bad boy is the ps5 controller now oh my gosh i haven't had so much practice on this thing but it is so hard to play claw in here it's really bulky and just like a thick boy like no suss on that so it's gonna be kind of difficult to play clown here but it is possible okay so once again this is a normal ps5 controller there's nothing special about it it has no paddles or anything if you already watched the ps4 part just skip ahead to the next part it's practically going to show you the same thing for a more detailed guide just check out the ps4 part go back in the video and watch that but i'm going to show you it real quick if you're a fast learner watch this all you're going to do is come here at a straight angle notice how my hand isn't like this it's like this on the side i come in at the side i put my two back fingers to support the controller on the bottom and then i put it against my hand like this from there i'm resting my middle finger on either button it doesn't matter so i'm going to come in just like this rest it here this this is almost even awkward for me and then you come here and then now i have full control of the back two buttons and my pointer finger can press all the face buttons so that you have it perfectly set up in the right hand all you want to do with your left hand is the same thing you want to come in at an angle just like this you're going to wrap your two bottom fingers to hold the controller and then from here your middle finger is going to be in charge of pressing these back two buttons just like this never ever use your pointer finger to press this button up here and the same thing on the other side you're not doing claw if that's the case so from here now that you have everything set up in the best way possible then you're pretty much good to go now that we got everything set up let's go to the next portion of the video so if you're watching this video all the way through let's get it next thing we're talking about is things to know on an xbox controller what i recommend doing is doing right hand claw only and then on the left side just do a normal grip do whatever you want though on a ps4 ps5 controller i recommend doing double claw on both sides i just want to be clear that so one of the first things to note across all these is to never ever when you're playing claw grip press r1 or the right trigger the top right trigger here with your pointer finger never do that never do it on either side every time you play claw no matter what controller you're on you want to make sure that your finger your pointer finger is only in charge of pressing the face buttons if you're playing on the xbox controller and you're playing double claw on the left side never if you do it on the left side it's even worse than doing it on a ps4 controller because then you're taking your hand off the analog stick i'm gonna over exaggerate this point a lot but make sure you always twist your hand in every time you play claw one of the reasons why i twist my hand in a lot is so like i said i have easier access to these face buttons on any controller as well as there's not a lot of tension in my hand and wrist area over here because when you don't twist your hand in let's say i have it over here then i'm forced to do this tight pressured claw grip also you're probably tend to match more than one face button if you're way on the side and you're too far the other way i'm going to show you in creative in just a second but whenever you're trying to jump usually people have jumped bounded to the bottom button so a or x so what they do is they bring their finger down to press x but if you notice if you try and jump and swing your pickaxe which is a common action in fortnite what's gonna happen is it's gonna be really difficult you see this right here this action right here is going to be really difficult to try and press at the same time so you have to press jump and you have to shoot at the same time the swing your pickaxe so whenever i try to jump into someone's box what i do is i extend my hand off you see right there right here i'm extending my hand off just a little bit so i can have way easier access at pressing both at the same time this is a tip that i never heard from anyone and when i was struggling and trying to figure this out for the first time this is what i did so talking about that thing i was just mentioning what you try and do is you try and put a stair above your head and you try and jump i'm just gonna be hard to show you but i just showed you on the previous screen what you're gonna do is you're gonna jump and you're gonna swing your pickaxe at the same time to jump and exploit through that wall so what it's kind of gonna look like is i'm gonna run and i'm gonna jump and press it at the same time and notice how at the exact same time with that tip what i did was i took my hand slightly off so i can extend it more and get this angle you see how i'm like doing this with my wrist that's really over exaggerating the point but once again i had to stare above my head and as i set this up right what i'm going to do is i'm going to take out my pickaxe i'm going to jump and then when i get close to the wall i know i'm about to do the jump i'm going to extend just a little bit like this so i'm going to come and i'm going to go boom like that and then that's how you do it at the same time really quick reminder hit the sub button and like the video if you wanted something one important thing to note is that your hands are not used to this position in a short summary what you're gonna need to do is practice this for more than one week i talked about this in my last video but for example if you work out a muscle that's never been worked out before it's gonna feel hard at first and you're not gonna like that feeling too much because you're just not used to it after you kind of build up that muscle memory in your hands it's going to feel a lot easier over time so don't get discouraged in the first week that's one of the most important things to note out of this entire video i'll be honest it probably took me around three weeks to get semi-decent to the point where i felt more comfortable on it but for you it could take longer than that it could be my time or it could be shorter or it could be longer to sum this up as fast as possible the best way to have a stronger grip whenever you're doing claw i'm gonna show you on the other controller as well even though it's practically the same thing i'm pretty sure i talked about this a little earlier but what you want to do is make sure you seal the palm right here i want to put pressure on that and then do all the things i was talking about and how to grip it so that way on the same so but notice i'm doing it on both sides this way i can have i can press these buttons and be relaxed at the top portion of my hand with these fingers and then have a lot of pressure at the bottom that way i'll have a really good grip and i'll feel really comfortable and like secure you know like when you're tucking a baby with all the blankets that's kind of how this is so boom really tough over here and then you just loosely rest your fingers on the face buttons and press all the trigger you could do this fast while playing loose that way you don't get too much tension in your wrist in your hand so i'm not going to show you the ps5 version it's pretty much the same concept but if you have small hands the ps4 is the controller for you because you could play double claw and the controller in general is just really small so in everyone's hands you're going to be able to grip more of it and have a way stronger grip and not drop it at all and then you can you know do all the things i was just talking about where you loosely put your fingers on these face buttons now you're going to learn the most common mistakes when playing cards one of the main reasons why people stop practicing claw is because they can't get over using their finger to press the jump button what people tend to do is when they're playing claw they take their thumb off the analog stick and press the jump button like this there's no other way around this other than just constantly reminding yourself why you're in game to use your pointer finger while you're in the fight i wouldn't say a common mistake but almost a common misconception is that it actually hurts your hand now if there's sincere pain that's for you to judge and you should probably stop doing it if that's the case but most of the time it's just because your hands are not used to holding the controller like that no matter what you do for the first time it's always gonna feel really weird in the beginning it's not like you're holding it incorrectly or anything that's just how it is so for that just give it time patience is really key with that a while back my doctor gave me some hand stretches that i want to share with you guys that are gonna help you whenever your hands get really tight now i'm doing this motion because that's the literal stretch what you want to do is put your hands together notice how my palms are together as well and then even as i'm i bring it into my chest like this elbow's kind of high and then i just pull down right here and you should feel it all along your hands right here another quick stretch is to literally like pull your hands back a little bit don't hyper extend your hands or anything but a little pressure will help ease it up and stretch it out stretching is one of the things that doctors actually recommend and i did a lot at the beginning because it helps with your hand grip and also it helps you with getting faster reaction time i'm gonna give you guys some quick pointers that i wish someone told me when i first started playing claw specifically talking about the sensitivity just remember that your sense on console is a lot different from sense on pc so if you want to copy someone's sense just remember that they have to be on console if you're on console also every controller that i have here is gonna feel different so one person sense is probably not going to fit yours unless they're on the controller that you have and they're on pc then i would copy the sense that they have for the most part you want to come up with your own sense i'm going to leave a link to how to find your own sense down below i made the video i think it's better to have a smooth sense compared to a fast sense because you're going to be more consistent with your edits and it's going to just lead you to getting more victories it's that simple all right seriously remember this do not give up the entire time because i promise you that you're going to end up liking claw more than a normal grip if you're patient and consistent enough at practicing you're going to get really good i promise you you just need time the thing for you world club hasn't been announced

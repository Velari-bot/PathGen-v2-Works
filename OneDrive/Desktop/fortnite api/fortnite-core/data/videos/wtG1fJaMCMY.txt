pick off with an open Games first place again in Solo cash cup now I don't know if that's clickbait I'm not sure he actually came first in opens but I know he did really well and I know his ping right now is definitely wrong do not let the Ping fool you a is like on 60 ping I think it'll go up later in the game I think he's just got like the weird ping display glitch but I talk a lot about high ping players on my YouTube channel and I've never actually watched the vi that much being probably the most decorated High ping player pretty much his whole career he's been on like 50 to 60 ping top three in fncs he chug very very good in solos doesn't travel to zero ping the first time we saw him on zero ping I believe was actually at land so for those you guys thinking that you can't compete this game on 60 ping my man made land on 60 ping but I do want to see if he plays differently because of that does he have a different play style because of the higher ping or does he just pretend the ping doesn't matter I mean's aim has always been disgusting we've got threats in the call at least as well nice right so he still plays pretty aggressive most of these fights are off spawn or he open up with big damage I want to see what he does when it's like a proper equal Health box fight oh thirdy Action Four kills on the board this is game one open this is him playing Super aggressive looks like he doesn't go yeah he doesn't go for wall takes as much goes for the phas in ping doesn't matter okay this guy is just a full Katana Warrior zero clue what the plan was there but nice easy I think this is his ping with exit lag I'm pretty sure I think he has like 50 60 with exit lag that's the problem yeah you're hiding in a bush your oh my [ __ ] god threat unfortunately the call is not having a good time yeah we're going to watch some Op games then we're going to watch some finals games I want to see how he W Keys now he plays finals so far he's playing Super aggressive way more aggressive than I would have thought but nice little freeb eight kills on the board in opens already very solid P you not P what are you playing angles for oh gets the pre piece oh my God he's fast damn okay I wonder if this is going to be a situation if he just like he's higher ping but doesn't play like it you know [ __ ] everything like he's going to have to surely like not be able to take walls as much though right like surely we're going to see some like fake pickaxe swinging some like pre-ir surely once he gets in a high skill based matchmaking he can't just try and wall take on on good players okay goes for the phas in again we haven't seen him try to take a single wall yet he goes for the momentum phasins or the stair phasin which is smart probably one of the most important techniques you can learn if you're playing on high ping is learning the timing of getting a wall weak and then running at full momentum just breaking it as you go in nice phing again oh El looking good load out is looking crazy as well right now the extra structure damage on the pump helps so much as well for the peace control okay one pickaxe swing B hits the second and then goes for the pump shot we've now dropped 13 kills and we haven't taken a single wall off an opponent very I don't know how much we're going to see from this one video we'll see and then a phasing again okay so he does have a very specific play style this what I was hoping for this is the kind of stuff you can practice if you're a higher ping player or if you're even a lower ping player it's just good to having in Your Arsenal not having to rely on it as much N9 man rotating actually not bad for a game one with 15 kills yeah that's the aiv aim bro aiv had like the best sniper aim of almost any player gets the pre piece again good read player still gets out of it though now we're getting Lobby luix on backside unfortunately still playing for the elim though via still trying to get this elim on backside before rotating now it forced to rotate so a Good Meds creates a bit of space land on High Ground gets the double Ed but doesn't Ed it down he is only on about 110 Health though wants to pop the meds instead taking nowhere near as many 50/50s as what a lot of other Pros would got like 10 people in this call another phase in I want to see how long is this video before we take a single player's wall nice uses the katana to take The High Ground nice little kadana dash off the wall as we were saying from talking to muz you'll see the typhoon blade used a lot more in solos Deep End Game solos typhoon blade is probably better than the mask honestly if you can get it do we get the 19 kills 20 bombs off the cards unfortunately would have be nice gets the doubles players not on them goes up again this play is decent this is someone very decent until they randomly pulled out the katana wait what what okay that play was looking decent gets the piece gets the elim wow okay I know we're doing a V video can we what what was that shot yo do we just die to a cheatah okay he's facing this way I'm sorry I got to I got to check that out on what okay never mind he was facing him okay when I first watched it I thought the guy was facing the other direction that kid is still the truth but never mind in slow speed didn't look at crazy all right almost a 20 bomb on 50 ping to open things up all right I want to see him take a single wall still doesn't take the wall goes for the pickaxe phasing again o aim looking a little bit rough that's right if you guys haven't been following uh V's Trio situation as well now playing with booger and threats booger and threats opting to drop re for aiv so Boer aiv obviously called globals together getting second or was it third in fncs last year here really really good performance looks like they're running it back up again didn't really get a direct answer from Boer or threats on why they picked a v over Reed I mean one of the biggest advantages is going to be storm surge going from controller player as good as Reed is to then some with the vies a is going to help a lot for storm surge seport City doesn't have the best early storm surge you try and take the mountains to the north and you got to deal with Peter Bots teams so you're kind of trying to get more of your tags on the south area which has a few different teams but it was third came third with booger nice just absolutely frying okay damn yeah he open up most his fights with good damage again doesn't try to replace the floor I'm sorry I'm going to just keep saying this I'm going to sound like a broken record but when have you ever seen a fortnite pro get this many elims and hasn't taken or tried to take a single build piece that someone else already owned he just knows he's not going to get it and doesn't even try it's actually super interesting I was expecting to see some more pre-ir and some more like fake pickaxes again phases in nice he's also doing that a lot so a pretty common strategy when you're playing on regular ping is wait till someone resets the edit and then use your pump or your pickaxe to take it back since he knows he might not get it he seems to wait till they've reset and then goes for the phasing every time this player didn't end up resetting the wall but if they ended up resetting that wall like a lot of players would and it was back to normal help he would have just phased straight in so it seems like he does similar stuff to what a lot of low ping Pros will do but instead of going for wall takes it's all about getting the phas in which means you really got to hit your shots though I have more I have I've never seen I've never seen so many players just lean on the typhoon blade as this video so far it's like the fourth kid who's tried to go blade okay we go first time I think we've seen him try to take a wall the could have been holding inly get the piece as well crazy though see some h building out of a gets the wall ahead of him and ohom hits a Max shot we almost go down again we've almost gone down a few times here phas in again yeah I I think genuinely take away from this video if you're a higher ping player even if you're not you got to practice those momentum phas in seems super easy but if you can get it down to be able to do it like you know nine times out of 10 consistently it's super helpful I'm also going to watch some's final game to see if when he's versing like better opponents he plays differently I'm not sure why doesn't move to zero ping definitely good enough to to Warrant it but the first time we saw him when zero ping was literally at land he doesn't move for fncs he just keeps playing from Canada kind of respect it though also uploads like super consistently so if you want to watch more of A's content make sure you do on YouTube he's got a lot of videos all right 20 rotating here he got 11 kills this game's actually pretty solid opting to run the SMG rather than the assault rifle it's the Mythic but still a lot of Pros actually prefer the uh the assault rifle over the Mythic SMG even probably helps a lot for bleeding the damage through the lower ping you are the easier just to bleed shots through so you might need the extra fire rate of the SMG to try and bleed shots through to close out fights he's putting in big damage on the rotates running splashes and Bobs nice tone good awareness another refresh plays Super aggressively on backside he's got the extra whites in case like he gets hit though to be fair he's got a fair bit of white heels here to play the Stagger with and it's not going to go to heal off cuz only opens goes for The High Ground super aggressive plays has to give it up again he's only got 12 builds though now drops down to Alti Alti low doesn't go for the wall take again this is fascinating I I thought he' kind of rely on phasin a little bit I didn't think it'd be this different of a play style like petbot hoyo cold like all the other we watch never play like this m no one plays like this be 16 kill game this is two huge games two almost 20 bombs nice takes High only got three builds left though needs to go for a pump shot soon runs out of Mads goes down as Cooper how's Cooper 100 100 yeah Cooper was healthy there okay game five 200 points hold it down go through oh what is this load out only shotgun and surge fire SMG very gross is this that drop spot this tiny little random spot on the edge of the map wait he wait no wait he uses scroll wheel down for cone wait a second hold up no way is a VI on like 60 ping he's on like basically 60 ping right now and keb's that bad he has scroll wheel down as cone so I'm guessing I'm guessing scroll wheel up must be his his like scroll wheel reset but that is so hard to do when trying to build quickly having to scroll down and then select it every time that's like almost as bad as chimp binds feel like it's not that bad that is that bad that is terrible D think about every time you want to try and build something you have to scroll down just to pull out your cone at least he doesn't have double scroll like chimp has scroll down and scroll up B to build but it's still pretty terrible another phas in nice definitely has got the phasin down this the last game of opens watch and then we're going to watch some finals games cuz he almost won in the finals too he doesn't just do this to like terrible kids and opens my man's also almost winning solo caches on this P nice takes the cone finally takes a bill but I'm pretty sure he waited till the player was trying to edit out the top cone his aim is just absurd his videos are sick as well the editor props to the editor just like it's just backto back action and oh my god dude a frags out man what didn't realize how many kills he gets takes The High Ground early probably the earliest you seen him on High Ground so far really good material so it makes sense he's not putting down the void to teleport to but he's also not sitting as high as what a lot of other players do in solos a lot of other players in solos would sit much higher than this still got really good meds too oh goes to the player trying to chop him tracks the orb don't take it don't take it oh he doesn't smart enough to not then shoots it again and then takes it wait different player D aiv has some of the best aim I think you kind of have to feel like when you're playing on higher ping you just know you can't do mechanically some of the stuff that other Pros are doing right now so you just have to beat them with aim probably the main reason I thinker would have picked up a v over re honestly bro we know and re sorry you know Bo and V play well together as well which makes sense oh stuck on the zip line luckily not adsing here interesting just trying to put down pressure just going for the hitfire shots oh chops the whole layer out almost five come on we didn't get the win against cop we got to get this win surely nice first weak pump shot we've seen so far I'm pretty sure and oh no the first mistake drops down there's another player still in zone behind him all right I want to check out how he plays in finals this is the tournament from finals where he came fourth so he ends up coming fourth in finals on like 60 ping I want to see if he plays any differently when it comes to finals already we're 66 alive with zero kills so we're playing a lot safer off spawn at least goes for the phas in standard normal he's really confident taking a lot of AR shots get him weak before he engages nice got the void Boon here as well I feel like void Boon is super underrated especially in solos seems to be meaning the void mask a lot over the typhoon blade nice 39 alive so decently stacked first game running medkit and minis the only thing the video cuts out cuz the editor is hard to know what he's picking up and dropping doesn't get any extra meds on that one I'm interest to see which Sol are trying to stack more white meds in finals versus opens seems to be like the go-to load out right now is flashes and uh water Sprite or Bobs if you can carry them it doesn't even feel like I'm watching someone on high ping though I'm used to watching people on high ping and everything looks really delayed like their builds come out late their edits come out late it doesn't look like that though it's kind of weird gets high ground first gets front side control I'm surpris not see him building up a bit more here there we go now we're building up and taking he Zone PS back off though so he gives up The High Ground much sketchier holding High Ground when these Mountain zones pulled down so much easier places sit back with white meds and grief you gets the beams with the assault rifle does he take the wall does he just get in notices the players looking the other way and then goes for the wall take nice that's a really good impact that's a huge refresh he just got that in my opinion is the biggest skill that separates the best from still good solo players is just the ability to get these massive refreshes an end game Camy goes down if you didn't if you guys haven't watched my like V review watch along with mu definitely worth watching after this that's the one thing I learned from MZ is if my man's like 500 Ms he's chambles and he's going for a refresh he does not play his mats out he's always looking for a big refresh even if he's only like 500 mats in end game takes High Ground again okay okay all right I can try to give you guys tips on like phasing in and not trying to take walls but I mean at a certain point you just got to have aim like a VI apparently my man's aim is as disgusting as ever nice refresh again use the teleport to go for it got a lot of match this deep in the game 10 elims a huge first game in finals white tags on low ground nice there's the void Boon coming out so big in solos for just identifying where everyone is hly you should out so they can't up nice SM HS by the teammate in the call I'm not sure who that was I don't recognize the voice but basically telling to build a bigger platform so it's wider so in this late of a zone no one can TP up and over if you build a massive platform they have to go in zone to be able to get the angle to TP over make sure that no one gets above you was a good call honestly he had enough mats to to do it you can top two hit the o wait a second oh cancels the med kit try to go for the elim wait a second play doesn't know where he is luckily hits another tag and O risky but he wanted the extra point okay huge first game now looks like he's up to game four so I'm guessing he must go down on spawn a little bit still trying to figure out where he drops I think he just drops on this tiny little house on the edge of the map out near the ocean uses the katana smart I guess the play is weak knows he can't take walls only has to hit one tag may as well just use the typhoon blade ends up dropping the typhoon blade for the void M though at some point this game oh and then we drop it back okay so aiv is on the same page as Muzz if you get the chance to refresh your void Mast for a typhoon blade and switch it out late solos typhoon blades better than void Mast seems to be most the top tier Pros recommend this looking for a refresh only has 30 builds left at this point gets it in zone as ritual can't go for that though this typhoon blade is looking good though at the same time nice another good position again there's the refresh doesn't have a master to find out man if you know how to use the typhoon blade though you can really get across these moving zones so quick oh typhoon piece off the cone doesn't get the sidewall though we know we already knew he was going to face that we all knew he wasn't going to try and take that staying slly elevated not going ulti ulti low but he's also not trying to play higher either or the invisible Medallion oh no playing the early meds top five again not a a victory cup format anymore sometimes playing the med kits ear to get extra placements worth it picks up the Mas still holds on to the typhoon blade as well picks up the master probably a to teleport in he has staggered back this once this is definitely the advantage of the Mask over the blade oh doesn't get that elim that guy was so weak the siphon would have been huge still a good game though 241 points yeah I think his drop spot also again you know you're on higher ping you just can't 50/50 you can't scroll wheel any of the chests so he goes a much safer solo drop than a lot of the other guys who are doing well in solos right now do nice good drop down piece see how he builds for High Ground we haven't seen him do too many build fights here baz is in again oh my it's ey drop yeah well actually one player in the lobby the have better ping then actually it was ey drop still shows he doesn't even try to take the wall though even when is on European Pro doesn't even attempt all right he's running void mask again this game I think you guys might have been right I think the typhoon blade was only CU his mask ran out of uses I think he he does prefer the void mask even Deep End Game HS bit of Zone but gets front side control to water zone so elevates up one layer you don't want to be on the very bottom layer in a water Zone that's where all the shambles players are and they can easily just phase up through the floor always want to try and play one layer up in these water zones especially if you can unless you have water Bo which obviously is nice to be able to touch down and get a free Med refresh but without it nice presses him predicts the opponent gets the refresh okay this is a good example oh there you go drops the mask no never mind I was correct okay so drops the mask for the typhoon blade so he is on team MZ this is deep deep end game to be fair though this is like the last few rotating zones oh and then picks up the master we're going double never mind going double the rotation top five Super consistent he's currently checking Q time see where he gets another game tries to pressure height only has one build though trying to find this player in zone he knows someone's nearby top top three oh goes down to High Ground so many top threes okay this is his last game I'm pretty sure straight into end game gets his first kill in Top 40 second kill wow just straight up Spring nice gets front side stays elevated again only has 2 hard Mass though you probably start looking for a refresh pretty soon I imagine especially once he's already front side s on second High needs to be careful High ground's probably going to start looking this first time we've seen him on alul low here he's only got 400 wood nice tags needs to find something super needs to find something very soon though he's running out there it is nice only Cipher Mass though that guy with shambles on backside decent refresh so he's running Mass this game top 10 dude I'm super impressed though I know there's people out there again my South African homies I'm sorry I know you guys are on like 150 ping but 60 ping is like very high for most people playing this game and I've got a lot of viewers who will say that like you know they've given up competing cuz they're on like 40 ping V very much the example of you can still do it my man's top three to fncs made land top four in Solo cash cup like you can do it for sure takes a specific play style but it's not worth giving up not going to try and pretend it's not a disadvantage but it's always nice to know that if someone's doing it you can too if you apply yourself enough top seven so got the one Bob if he wants to stagger here I think he might here tank a bit of Zone see if he gets the refresh oh players pushing him nice siphon no no that's disastrous that's unfortunate did you see it B like five times that's really unfortunate that yeah that could have been way more points there that was probably or maybe the difference between getting top three he could have I don't know winning that with all the kills was pretty tough but damn fourth place 60 ping V the high ping goat I'm going say it

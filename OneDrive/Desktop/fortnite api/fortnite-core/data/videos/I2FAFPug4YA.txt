if you get Max zones every single zone how are you going to win if you don't pull zones in the solo Victory cash cup you might not be able to earn but today I was able to coach a subscriber in the most recent solo Victory cash cup and he kept getting Max PS but we were still able to put him in the best position I'm going to show you guys exactly how to play when you don't get the Zone let's get into it let's get it bro I'm with it where you uh I'm landing you know that like henchman chest outside of pleasant um like the blue house it's uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I yeah yeah is that the spot yeah that's the spot I got to Grappler every game in open so I think I'm landing there if you're down to try a spot I got a spot for you all right I'm I mean if this doesn't go good we can try game one easy yeah yeah yeah cuz the only the only issue that I see with this spot is not that like like you're just going to be like potentially surrounded by a ton of yeah a ton of people right like there might be three Four Guys lazy or what am I saying four guys uh salty Four Guys Pleasant Four Guys sweaty and then you're just like there looting like nothing so yeah I would usually I'd usually get this and then Scout over here and then come back here and just kill the kid over there all let's go oh my friend's in this game I coached a little bit of EU earlier so it should be perfect did he make money he did not he had a big issue with overbuilding a o auto pickup just is not in my thing wait you're Landing blue marker no I'm I'm landing here at the house nice there's only one kid so like I could I could go into Pleasant this game definitely chill you see what skin that guy is Pleasant uh yeah it was a soccer skin it was like Grappler already yep I wouldn't even waste your time farming this if you're planning on one to fight that guy I would look to like that guy's one guy at Pleasant that's not that's a lot of loot to get and a lot of opportunity for lur on him if you're confident with it don't Don't Force It But like I would just focus on getting mats getting on top of yellow house cuz he landed dog house for sure yeah like just get all this brick here ah [ __ ] it you're good you're good definitely mat up though yeah and yeah when you when you do do this like you're doing good right now but just don't let don't build like you know you don't want him to know at all zero chance for him to know you're here yeah I guess I got like no chest it's above you here okay [Applause] yeah don't worry about Metal just to get your wood try to get on Yellow House quickly I would loot this and just yeah got top yeah break the roof on the back side yeah perfect you're ready to be able to see audio like visuals and [ __ ] he's at Red House you just saw him red brick left red you just broke that roof out yeah yeah you're good this perfect I would go like make sure it's guaranteed fry yeah I mean if you have control like if you want and you don't fry him well you could like fry him try to fry him go scrapple to that big pot get the big pot Po and then fight him if you want you don't have to fight this guy but I think it's a free opportunity he's just not he thinks he has every house to get just be patient his next like this is his next house he's at red brick right now or he should be yeah so and he's there's no way he goes to middle like and there's also no one around you there's no one that's going to come behind you so if anything I hope he goes to his front door and I just drop on his one yep yep oh he's going around W he is he doesn't know you're good go to go to the middle pavalion or Pavilion thing prob these fenes [ __ ] like get you're good you you go to the middle no I'm getting the big pot okay okay perfect yeah yeah you pass prob he's probably in that basement he's at that house yeah he just went into it yeah all right so he's fully shielded and he has at least a green pump cuz there's a green pump here farming in there yep make your play now he's in a building this isn't going to help you he's not going to come back to this he's going to he's going to go all the way around you take out R around and try to I think you should just run towards gas and just get like he's in the building right now like you can you can get on the gas he's going to go to the blue house next I would just wh line to it launch pad there too he's not going to come he's going to go blue house next if he's not already there and blue house is really quick to loot so he's going to be in the field in a second here or in the bottom you can play middle this would be bad he's on top of the building a that's tough he saw you the entire time I guess that's why he ran away from I just I think I just farmed the metal right you just yeah yeah go for it leave him alone yep wait oh my gosh fine thought this didn't break Inc F there's so much metal like here and in the bottom yeah bro take the risk at that point yeah all right you can go down if you want get that basement in the basement yeah isn't there a basement yeah there is like down in down there yeah I don't know if it's teleport only it might be I can pop this big pot real quick and then I could hit the pter potty right here yeah there's another SC chest yeah just get all these open and then you can figure out what you want to carry I think I'm just going to carry yeah another chest to get is is it really heal off in this season uh I mean it depends on what your lobb is like the games I was watching earlier and and play like coached earlier he was just like they they they were really really dead but that was also like one of the games that just went down the hill the other game it did go to heal off but like it wasn't anything wild yeah cuz like in op I had like craziest thatat game and it it just didn't go to heal off cuz everybody has a Grappler so it's just like they're just all grappling around and they're just not using that many mats and then like when they do run out of mats they just grapple around look for a kill so I won two games in opens and I just grappled on high F the kid and killed him I think the big thing in this which we'll do like you could do this game depending it's pretty dead I would lowkey rotate towards risky here and get all your brick and just you should be having a spaz every single game like right there like if we're quick enough I know that like we were lurking on that guy but next games our goal is like do your thing be quick get that like get your mats up cuz the metal there is good like you just I mean your cap like you brick is get these rocks to your right rocks to your right rocks to your right yeah yeah cuz you want to go and risky right now all you need is 350 brick I think yeah to from green to purple okay so like you'll lose your metal but you'll be all right you'll be just fine I think there's extra metal here yeah know there definitely is there's metal all over the map so there's kid right here keep your eyes on him figure out what he does I think he WS I think you're good oh he's right there go for it I'm going to wait he has no idea definitely saw your visual I think he did all good can we can we get out of this and just um I'm going to go around right I want you to get upgrade here if you can there's no brick the only brick is in this building you have to go in the building to farm the floors in here no in the M that one yeah I don't know if there's a there's a yeah there's a rock over here right to your right yeah there is I I think I could upgrade and salty right there's uh yeah there rocks right there go get those rocks go get those rocks to your left you're good you're yeah you're good you're good you're good this game is so dead yeah 100% all right I got you even if I lead you into a flaming pit of death I will get you out of it like believe me everything I'm saying I got you I'm thinking 10 steps right now just clear these bushes first cuz you know there's someone in this so pump that one and pump the other one behind you there was there was a guy in there yeah there was a kid you're good so clear it just AR tap it like hit fire whatever there you go perfect every time we run by Bush do that every time make sure yep perfect go upgrade you're good Focus upgrade go go it's on the back side where that guy was running yeah right here yeah yeah there it build on it oh good perfect now try to scrap Farm your metal real quick in the POI maybe on a car I don't know if there's cars uh there's a there you go just anything you can get 12 there there's like all this furniture right here to your right like in Stand just careful breaking like the cash reg break the registers first focus focus metal metal not wood all right um fan above you a let's go that tick doesn't matter obviously right no no no no just just keep running to Zone here keep capping up your your mats as you go we'll get you capped open map here for a second so I can just get a okay cool gas station is going to have extra metal too watch footsteps I would try to try to work towards gas right now that's your goal all right just build off these players you have more than enough mats to build them off you're good don't don't uh laser focus yeah watch watch other people though there's people in front of you soon oh this sitting on the launch pad it's fine you hit that p i no just run it in C this bush farm this brick right here these little walls all right don't worry about tanking this is 30 brick per two all right no you're it's fine it's fine there's enough mats 58 up bro this is a really dead game again work towards gas here you need you need to like one thing I'm picking up right now right away that's going to get us [ __ ] up like we're going to get like fried or something and you don't have big pots is like stop being so focused on one guy like quick second look at him he's not looking at you like someone's going to be to your left kind of like what happened there like you were looking at the guy in the river and then the guy on the pad was there and you were so laser focused on the guy in the river for no reason like he wasn't even looking at you he I don't even know if he knew you were there just quick look at him all right next like Keep Your Head On on a swivel cuz snipers are in the game you think I go over there FR brick yeah definitely head on a swivel though always looking around perfect open map for a sec so I just get a mental picture all right cool we'll go we'll just keep wrapping this left side here all right get this brick all of it cap your mats here or at least cap I got the bug and you're just going to wrap up all the way up this River here so just keep working up and then eventually we'll wh line should I maybe use a Grappler no no know there's some bricks up ahead you're good you're going to cap off this yeah all right keep working up the up the river here might get a chest here in one of these that tent I think or ammo box you're good get this wood don't pass these mats oh you cap your MS pump pump the bush always clear it like it's okay to it's way way better for you to clear it check your left you think the cars work check your left check your left no oh is there a car yeah yeah take it take it let take it all the way down the river farm farm these trees right here to your right up right these yeah this and the trees like cap your mats before you get in this car these trees you see them you can drive the car to it but oh yeah yeah I don't know what I'm doing anytime you go over a ridge by the way anytime head on a swivel like your blind spots like right now is you went over a ridge right so any like there could be five people on top of this Ridge and you'd have no idea from down there in that truck so every time like like you went uh you got that chest and then you went down the river and didn't check your left and I had to call it out like I want you to do just automate that all right do I stop and L or no no just I would just drive and's get this I would just drive and Vibe like you got 30 seconds you have no goal right now your goal is to not get shot so like just VI near these trees just kind of sit hang out y like the deeper you go in you're getting it you're going to get in more people's range just chill chill chill chill chill chill stop driving stop driving no no no I want you to just chill in the car all like you can move it around you can drive around you can sit if you want I it doesn't matter you just I don't want you to expand and explore too much cuz you're going to get your car shot people are going to see you this is perfect all right this is Lally Perfect all right let's go go down the river or actually go up sorry go up well yeah open map here for a sec all right perfect Hill Zone all right also when we get in here you're going to get sprayed at that's fine all you need to do is if you're getting excessively sprayed switch seats and build okay and if you're ever going to box like oh I'm going to box in this rock nothing breaks right rocks don't break right no you're not you're not keep keep going Center Center Center Center but listen to me you're just going to switch seats and box on your car like you're not going to get out of the car and box the car just stop the car switch seats you can box in the street here box in the street sit switch seats switch seats oh you're good go to the Hut go to the Hut oh my gosh the Hut yeah the Hut right here just switch oh it's not letting me switch it's l not letting me switch all right just okay box the car it's fine there's break behind you just box your car box your car don't let it get hit box your car use wood here this is good oh it's fine you can use use more wood to box the front of your car it's all in the open here all right thank you nice there you go perfect okay there's a tree you can Farm I think all right I'm going to explain to you why like I switched the coms get that tree of course so two things right just you understand what I was trying to explain just whenever you're ready to stop if you see like a big rock and a tree perfect just pull your car right next to it switch in second seat and build around it and you'll box your car perfectly you could build a 4x4 like or a 2 by two like you just did yeah I mean but also the reason why I told you to stop here again is just you're stopping on cover like you're stopping on builds this is the whole goal like so the next spot you're going to go to wherever it's next Zone whenever we decide to go is like you find a rock that's in a good position you know Center zone or in X position hill whatever box your car switch seats box the car Farm the mats up do it again repeat keep the car alive as long as possible eventually it's going to you know it's going to die but yeah yeah and I didn't know I forgot this Hut was here so I was going to tell you to go to the Hut but should I just I just drive in just wait yeah let me see open map here so yeah you need you need to like stay on this left side of the Hill like you can't go to the river you need to go other side yeah let me see yeah so yeah look at look at blue marker you need to drive up there and like left of blue like see the guy farming the tree yeah yeah like you need to go like like towards him yeah kind of towards him you might want to go to the left of him because wait you thinken just look at just just look see the blue guy or the guy on the blue yeah focus focus focus see the car the truck that's where you want to go if not more left than that you can go there or more left okay yeah one more wall it send it down right and up and I would go more left cuz there's a guy there and the hills we shooting at like that path in between is not good left here all right perfect and you're going to swing all the way around just keep staying away from this guy oh this is perfect he not even looking hey you're good you're good I get yeah out here right no I wouldn't have but box your car box your car box your car again we're going to be doing all three games so I want to tell you if I if I say like there's so many things that are automated like if you're getting sprayed there obviously like if you get cracked I'm not going to tell you to like hop out of the car just instinctively got to do it but like things like this just keep going like you really you should have kept going it's fine but I mean yeah but like I can't like if you do a play that I'm thinking of like I'm thinking of this long play deeply thought and then you do something that stops it halfway then I have to think about how to you know what I'm saying now I have to work off this scenario which is fine we can do anything but I'm just trying to tell you to like be comfortable with just me being the brains and you literally just being able to shoot your gun and box people that's all you got to do yeah I think from here do I just grapple cuz I'm just going to get lobed the whole time now worry about shooting your gun I'm going to tell you what to do look out of this cone to the right like this this wood box here like put a cone and Scout it perfect um if you can position the car to drive up this hill that would be your best bet like if you can back it up here yep like back out of your car here you're not going to go yet but you're going to edit this wall not yet and then you're going to go out of this back here and you're going to try to get up theill oh you're editing the walls already yeah like this yeah yeah yeah is there not a guy he just ped yeah go for it go for it then it's good you want this good no you're good you want to just drive off right yep go left here go left here chill chill chill back up mhm go left it's okay to fall off the hill perfect right there that Gap keep keep keep going go all the way to uh try to you try to go up here right here see this little yeah perfect wow it's okay to go left here cuz there's a lot of left side you're fine does this bring me up I don't think it does just go down go down you have Grappler so it doesn't really matter that much there is a lot of people down here but it's okay there's a guy here or no it's old oh he's healing perfect try to get up if you can like so follow the grapp up yeah I would keep going keep going through this keep going through this perfect perfect perfect get the tree box in the tree against and brick brick brick on the tree perfect perfect perfect just like that every time now you can hop out now you can hop out you just want to build a base like that you can hop out eventually you're going to have to yeah put a floor here on your left and wood there you go okay it's all good and if it pulls up just like grapple right yeah at that point yeah open your map see if it lets you explore it so we can actually there we go yeah I mean it's it's a cook Zone it's probably it's I mean it's not going to pull down there's just no shot you're going to have to Grapple up but I would rather have you had C this than like you saved a lot of HP and mats yeah can you no you can't I can probably drive this yeah you can you can you should try also don't feel like you have to go W key speed the entire time like you can slow down in a car i' box on this per switch seats perfect now you hop out you have the base build like the base of it the solid core a couple walls fix your car put it in Wood here like just cone out perfect break that wall in between so it's like nice and even this one this one yeah and I think you're missing the wall it's left of the car there yeah perfect good to go you're not in zone here by the way so I would just tarp in one box that way you can like grab this brick wall like I would go in with with one metal box here I'm still not now okay I'd go in one go yeah it's fine he's there there's a guy right here save it I would just lowkey go up on right no no no no I would see can you you got the wall back you got the wall back careful yeah yeah yeah I should I should get out of here yeah you could I'm in here can you try to grab this guy's wall back and just control it like safely yeah like you could pressure his front wall now if that makes sense like you could kind of just get him out like you could pressure him away just there you go pulls back to me perfect just five out all right five out I got you open map here pulls up a hill you're not going to build a car y okay you need to put a cone down and yep and edit your cone three ways there you go so you're protected you need to get off this layer can you just don't go out yet you you need to go out and around like you can't I don't think you can get through this no hold on wait okay let me see you may be able to squeeze through this little hole behind you like you to go like towards that car yeah yeah towards that metal cone you see the metal cone actually holding it's fine you're going to go out and around then you're yes yes yes just nice and protected though you can wait you grapple it's fine you just don't want to be like that guy don't get pumped by this kid yep you can edit this perfect out around grapple bro fine grapple box right away nice you're in zone here this is perfect it's a Hill Zone too you win this game okay once you pop this get in your top gun okay all good pull down pull down just sit in your top gun sit in your top gun switch to Wood here all right we got this we're going to sit and wait okay I got you I'm going tell you exactly what to do don't even worry about height keep looking at it though see that guy in M right there yeah you want to stay up elevated if you can box as soon as you can switch back to Wood I wouldn't even wor about height right now grapple is just griefed like so griefed everyone's looking for it down let me edit this wall and reset edit this wall reset so I can see just wait a second you have so much time but yeah you're going to go on that brick layer like a above it right one lay above it like right there yeah yeah that's fine box yep look at it again just to see it's fully fighting yeah he just died look kill feed who is it a random you try to spray and see what what happens it's one guy two is it one or two yeah be patient look drop front maybe and then spray like on That Metal yep perfect oh wow that was a crazy grapple good poop your mini it's going up a hill here can you get in your cone real quick you're top nine you're going to grab out of your cone here wait what's height there's no height okay be patient should I get that just grab no no no grapple on this guy's top perfect just Spam grapp here chill you're good keep looking at it there there the the the the bouncer in storm you see the bouncer in storm yeah yeah yeah and build up take it be aggressive build up build up build up just use your mats commit commit commit commit okay I I don't have MS like that I know you did but it's okay just SP drop them out drop up nice you have it they're all fighing for yeah make a play for somebody you're someone's just going to keep grappling to you or spray you might get it it's a Hill Zone just keep spraying actually you're going to get this yeah and get ready of the grapple okay instant instinct is just grapple nice this guy's weak from before grapple you're good you're good so healthy dude that's just impossible nice try zone is so bad I didn't kill a single person that's tough that's just like dude I mean I bet you the guy that killed you has no mats and like is just on nothing it's just so grief just it's just the Grapplers is so it's so spammed it's crazy everyone has so many charges no but okay what I was saying though for height like just a general Ru thumb for any game mode so doesn't matter like for the rest like just a perfect thing to work off of if you're ever going to go for height like that's why I was like I gave you the com be aggressive like you're committing to it like that is like right there just if you outu that guy you probably save more mats like if that makes sense if you just like if you had a chance to like you could cheap 90 that you just put a wall stair wall stare all the way up and like you're just committing to it at that point like you can never go for height and just half commit like you had maybe you didn't see your mats but you had like 220 it's not a lot but like I'm just saying as like a general competitive rule of thumb it's the the grappler makes it like almost not true because it's so like people are just grappling with no mats and it's kind of like everyone's sending height but any meta like it could have been last season like if I was to coach you just same thing if you go for height you're sending it like there's no like half building there's no like you just need to go for it so you almost had it but it's tough if you were able to kill that guy too I mean you would have got all those mats and I think you would have won it yeah the guy was one HP I didn't have time to shoot him but he grappled up yeah all good you think I should go back to where I was I think you're fine with that yeah like if I Got One Singular kill I guaranteed win that game yeah yeah had a campfire everything I could have shot uh healing white honestly you maybe if you had like a couple builds when you like slung into storm on accident on that like pump yeah you could have if you had a build or two you could have put a floor down campfire pop Med kit start playing heal off then grapple back and you're going to do like the psycho plays that the guy that killed you did like you're just grappling with nothing and you just hope you hit the shot yeah I mean you almost killed that guy if that was a better shot than like 30 damage you would have I6 yeah thank you guys so much for watching and don't forget I host a Tuesday thesis every single Tuesday at 2 PM CST so get your gameplay watched get your questions answered and I'll see you there

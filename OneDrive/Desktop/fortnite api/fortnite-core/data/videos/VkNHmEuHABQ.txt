if you have trouble winning rank games in fortnite then this video is exactly for you as I'm going to be going over my gameplay and how I win so many rank games without breaking a sweat and I'm also going to be showing the enemy POV to show you exactly what not to do so first I'm going to talk about offs spawn fights and for offs spawn fights you got to play it smart and you can't do what this guy does here in a minute so basically as I'm landing I see him in the corner of my eye and I see a shotgun and an SMG and in this case always go for the SMG or the automatic gun so that you can get some shots off if you see him I didn't get a good look at him so I ended up just looting up instead and just stayed cautious of wherever he would be so now we're on his POV and I didn't even know there was a slurp truck here so I'm going to go after that every game now but he gets a slurp truck he doesn't even go for the chest behind him for some reason then he gets some Shock waves he opens the chest and then he does something that he shouldn't have done which was to literally just Camp here for the next minute and a half instead of looting up he just decides to stay behind a fridge and just not do anything so now back to my POV I'm already halfway looted up I don't have any mats but I do have full shield and I'm always looking in the direction that he is whenever you mine a tree always look in the direction of the player you last saw so that you don't get caught by surprise and here he is still camping behind the fridge eventually though he opens the chest and for whatever reason he thinks that's secure to go ahead and push me and keep in mind this guy doesn't even have any mats so here I am being proactive in actually getting mats in preparation for this fight so as I'm farming I'm still being cautious and boom in the corner of my eye I see him on the roof and I whiff a few shots and he hits me for 75 then he decides to shock wave on me and pulls the Thunder pump from hell and it's important not to panic in this situation as you can see I'm composed and I hit the shot on him and here he is with no mats and I end up finishing the fight with a right hand Peak so to sum up offs spawn fights you want to grab an AR to get some shots off if not then loot up quickly get mats and prepare for the fight don't be like this guy who fought underprepared because he decided to camp in a house instead of getting mats so later on I'm in a car and I'm driving around to see if there's anyone nearby since it's edge of Zone and it's early the game nobody else is going to third party this so when I see this kid I immediately start shooting at him get a beam on him he starts building he's nervous he shock waves away and just like that easy kill guys half the kills I get in this video are all from beaming people which goes to show you don't need to be an exceptional fighter to win these games all you need is good aim and good game sense in knowing when to actually initiate a fight if you take into account your surroundings and see if there's anyone else nearby initiating fights is so easy and ending them just the same way so here a car shows up and I play this perfectly you got to know how to stay calm in this situation as I get hit here I'm still building up to height I pop a mini he chops me out again and then that's when I start shooting him and here you cannot miss your shots you have to get rid of the car as fast as you can so in a matter of 10 seconds his car blows up but to my surprise there's another car waiting for him but the same things apply you got to build up stay calm and get rid of the car as fast as you can after tagging him a bit he drives away and I drink a big pot and then he comes to drive out again so that's when I blow up his car so I begin to chase him and as I'm landing I see a bush always check to see if there's anyone in a bush if you're chasing someone and while he wasn't there he was just ahead of me so I start shooting at him crack him and now I'm chasing him again and this guy did a horrible job initiating a fight and trying to run off you can't just start a fight and when you can't finish it not expect the other guy to come chasing you right after so here he is boxing up and he makes the worst mistake which is to not put a stair or a cone in your box so I drop down and hit him with the pickax bait always do this if you're dropping on someone's wall by the way and since he doesn't buy into it I do this peak that allows me to get the wall easily and since this wall is 1 HP I shockg and replace it easily get it drop down put a cone in his box hit him once and this guy's cooked no unnecessary 50/50s no unnecessary edits just a clean kill this next kill is nothing crazy but I mean this guy has a reaction time of a block of cheese so I Shockwave on him take up the easy kill that's it so as I'm driving I hear some shots whiz by do not do what this guy does just shooting at whoever he wants this is exactly how you don't want to initiate a fight cuz you never know that the guy might spin back and that's exactly what I do so he just runs away like sweet or something I mean I don't even know what he was expecting I beam him and then I go after him and then he pulls out his Oni mask and for some reason he doesn't teleport away and then he decides to Med kit up facing the other direction guys if you get beamed please Escape as fast as you can do not stop for a medkit do not stop for anything you're going to get beamed easily with hit scan guns this season and also really quickly if you guys want to get better at fighting check out Destiny's fighting masterclass in the description I don't want to talk about it anymore let's get on with the video as you can see there's an Eminem right here on edge of Zone and he initiates a fight you do not want to initiate a fight on edge of Zone and why is that well because of people like me I third party as many times as I can in every single game that I play especially if you're in shambles you do not want to fight at edge of Zone when the circle is literally 500 mil away but yeah like I said before if you combine good aim and good game sense then you will win all of your fights by Third partying it's literally the easiest way to win your games in fortnite and before you go insulting me in the comments just to let you guys know I am a pretty good fighter but I'm not going to sweat it out in these gold lobin and also I don't even play solos I haven't played a solo before this game since chapter 5 season 3 all right enough rant anyways it's top three and what I do for the rest of this end game I want you guys to follow very closely first I want to talk about Resource Management only place metal if you plan to stay in that box for more than like 2 minutes and brick if you want to rotate soon but you want to box up first and then finally wood for temporary placement if you want to get people to stop shooting at you or if you're fighting someone but never box up in Wood because you will get beamed also save your mats near end game because you don't want to be like these two kids down below who are just fighting it out and burning all of their mats and this is exactly what you have to do if you're on height which is to pressure people below you pretty simple stuff just make them waste mats and also make sure you're aware of your surroundings make sure you're aware of the terrain that's coming up ahead of you and the hill in front of me gets exposed so I'm able to only mask right away to it and secure height for the rest of the game and that guy gets picked off and this guy is in complete shambles and he dies the storm in this next game I land at the same spot and on and automatic gun once again and there's a kid that landed right next to me I get three shots off but I'm not able to kill this guy because he runs away in a cyber truck so after fully looting up I go look for a fight and usually in these lobbies people are always focused on fighting each other before actually looting up and getting enough mass for one as you can see I have full wood and full brick so I'm able to third party this with ease I didn't get that Elum there but this guy did not pick up the loot from him so he doesn't have any mats and he's gone later on this guy shows up out of nowhere he shock waves up to me and I pull my shotgun out to get the first hit on him he blanks me I hit him for 26 he boxes up then shock waves away I get a good Beam on him and for some reason this guy didn't box up with a brick or something so I end up hitting him for like 35 there this guy makes a crucial mistake in boxing up in wood and just like that he's gone here I am getting the forecast Tower or at least trying to when I hear a car pulling up and he's I don't even know what he's doing I don't know why he just drove straight into me but yeah he's gone again you want to have good game sense and you want to know when to third party people you don't want to be third part you want to be the third party that's exactly what I do here so when I go to fight this kid I'm using a right-and peak to try to get this floor somehow I didn't get it there I'm on zero ping I don't even know how I didn't get that but he catches me off guard here because I was trying to place a stair and he Faz through it unfortunately I didn't end up killing him we both just left so uh this guy here he gets tagged for 6 I use my orb to teleport instantly and with no time to heal this guy starts to box up in wood stop boxing up in Wood please and I use this right hand Peak always use this right hand Peak from a box Above This is the best way to take a wall and just notice how I'm fighting from range he can't even see me and this is why 50/50s are best avoided because you can just kill people from range like this it's top three in this massive zone so I have forecast and I know exactly where I need to be positioned this guy I saw in the corner of my eye and I saw another kid going into this Warehouse thing or train station thing I don't even know and this guy's an easy kill I mean he's not really good you can tell by his skin oh please do not take that out of context I am not racist finally it's a 1 V one and I've been waiting for this guy for the past 2 minutes but he gets to jump on me he tags me once I tag him too and I get hide on him easily and I don't want to just 50/50 I want to learn how he plays first I don't want I don't want to just like you know jump in and get hit and here I see he doesn't have a cone or a stair in his box so right when I break his floor I place a stair he ends up tagging me because I accidentally made a wide open edit but anyway he goes off the heal I go off the heal he throws an orb to teleport ahead of me to go ahead of zone I'm still healing I'm playing patient I know that I'm kind of low on mats at this point I take some fall damage but it's fine because I medkit behind terrain use terrain if you're on height so that people don't know where you are I catch him off guard crack him and at this point I see he's building in metal so I know he's low on mats after orbing and getting height on him he ends up hiding in a box for some reason I mean I guess it's cuz he's low on mats and I tried to check here if he was low on mats or not but it wouldn't tell me now we're box fighting and I'm playing from range once again making sure he doesn't get a tag on me and he's actually playing smart here he's breaking the wall because it's low on HP I mean unlucky for him he couldn't replace my wall so anyways I go up for height he tries to go for a shot here but I'm protected with my ramp and then he boxes up but he forgets to put a cone so I phase in and just like that he said that's going to be it for this video If you guys enjoyed please leave a like And subscribe and comment down below what you want to see next and also if you want to become a better

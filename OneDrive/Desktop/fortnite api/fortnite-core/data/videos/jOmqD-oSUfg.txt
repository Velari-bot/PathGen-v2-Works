this is Pro Player bolts at the fncs Texas land after dominating all season and this is me with only 200 PR and minimal earnings there's no saving me but after seeing Bolt's recent placements I decided to lock myself in my basement and train like bolts for 24 hours the plan was simple aim train then play some tokens against some no lifes on Zone Wars and finally scrims because that's the best practice for end game and then I was going to play the fncs qualifiers to see if this practice helps me qualify spoiler I got 21 kills so if I were you I'd stick to the end so without further Ado let's get into it so for the first couple hours I was starting strong in the aim training as you guys can see I beat some of my records and if you guys want to know my aim train routine all I do is do up close strafing because for fortnite that's really all you have to practice and also this is the map that I use for ingame because I feel like if I'm actually aim training my long range aim I want to train it in game just so I can get the most realistic gameplay so if you guys want to know bolts is exact aim routine that I actually watched him do on this map on stream I'm going to show you guys real quick so he starts with the launch Bots and I like to do until I'm comfortable I don't really have a timer then I skip that one then that one's a little too easy so I go to this one then I do 360 tracking just to end it off and the rest is pretty much useless it's unrealistic so yeah I was feeling amazing in the aim training today you guys can see my aim was looking amazing I had my sleeve on I was locked in had my music playing and I already had had a feeling I was going to do good in this tournament now that I was comfortable with my aim I just freebuild for a couple minutes and went straight into tokens and I got to say I went off you guys can just see some of the clips I got [Music] [Music] I'm telling you guys maybe I got the best sleap ever but I was ready for fncs I won all of my tokens so I ended up taking home 30 bucks so yeah I ended up buying a couple Big Macs with that but anyways let's move on to the last part of my day before fncs and that scrims just like my aim training routine I was feeling amazing in scrims I was making it to the late end game every single time picking up some nice refreshes and we were almost a, above on surge so we were absolutely going off in this scrim and that honestly got my hopes up really high for fncs especially since I'm more of a midgame fighter and scrims doesn't allow me to mid-game fight I knew I just had to hop in some pgs a little bit more and then go off in the mid game and literally just do exactly what I do in scrims in the end game and I would literally have the perfect tournament so yeah with that out of the way the big moment has arrived Trio fnc as qualifier it is now time to put all of my practice to work and see if it pays off let's do it right before we get into fncs guys if you guys enjoyed the video so far leave a like and if you want to support me even more consider using Code rth FN in the item shop and yeah that's it going into the first game we knew we needed a high kill game since it's the best way to start off the tournament and that's exactly what we did still there po don't get laser 40 cracked it's Booga it's [Music] Booga Miss 100 he's terrible there's another team there's another team coming killed one killed [Music] one 100 on Catwoman 100 on [Music] Catwoman Catwoman's one HP that dead oh right here dud dead oh my no I tpd so far bro one of them knocked 28 way 28 way

I need my kill I got it I got it go down go down go down go down go down I'm chilling I'm chilling I'm getting griefed dude get me out give me out that unfortunately we missed quad because my teammate could only play four games on day one which led us to having almost zero points even though we were doing amazing in all four games we were top 100 in the first four games then he couldn't play and then day two the same thing happened so yeah I'm not even that mad because me and my other teammate played to the best our abilities and even the teammate they left played really well as well but it just sucks but it's all good if you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like And subscribe hit that Bell so you never miss a video and comment the word prozone wars in the comments if you made it

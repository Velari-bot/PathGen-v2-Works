yo are you guys looking to edit like this well I'm going to show you exactly how you can edit like a pro first go ahead and jump into your settings and as you guys can see I do not have confirmed on relase on the tips that I use in this video are the only reason I can edit as fast as I can okay so your sensitivity is super important for editing my sensitivity is 2.9 on 1,600 DPI which is pretty low but I also like consistency over speed you're also going to want to come over to your keybinds tab and go to your edit building bind and make sure that it's something close to your index finger some good examples of this are e r f g c and V you can also use your side Mouse buttons if that's what you're comfortable with the last thing that you need to make sure that you do is go to your building edit bind and make sure that one of them is down or up on your mouse and then go ahead to the reset one and do the exact same thing this is going to allow you to reset your edits super fast just by scrolling up or down on your mouse build so this simple driller here is going to work on your edit time and what you're going to want to do is place a cone in a floor edit both the tiles and then reset them this is what many fast editors do to warm up their fingers once you get the hang of it you can start going super fast and you'll feel very consistent it's important to start off super slow and work on consistency and cross their placement on editing you need to build up the muscle memory before you can start editing super fast you guys should never ever start just trying to crank out a whole bunch of quad edits like this because that'll never ever work you guys need to go through the progression of starting off just to be able to do like a stack of double edits all the way up to Max height and then once you're able to do the double edits consistently and you have the muscle memory built now you guys can start trying to do triple edits and then try and get four of those and then five and then all the way to Max height until you get a consistent and down path the more reps you get in is the faster that you'll be at editing another thing that you can do to really focus on your edits is go into your settings go to the place build Bine and put this as something that you don't use on your keyboard for example mine is backspace and now if I place any items such as my phone or even like a water bottle on my backspace it places all the builds for me so now that I don't have to worry about my builds all I have to do is focus on editing I don't use this anymore but I did use it back in the day because it helped me get used to my editing consistency and remember if you're going to be a fast editor you must get a good collection of nice sounding pickaxes this is completely unnecessary but why not so that's it for the video guys I hope that this was helpful if you enjoyed please don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and as always thanks for watching

another season has passed and you have failed yet again because you are complacent you have an ego that you do not deserve you have pride and you are not willing to listen to the people that are better than [Music] you today's video is a snippet from a hourong group call coaching session that I did in Destiny's Jesus's solo Superstars if you're interested in that program the link is in the description but today we're going to be covering a very very important topic the common questions and misconceptions that people have when it comes to improving in competitive fortnite and how to train properly the end of the day guys you have to really value your time if you want to make earnings and value your time in such a way that you're improving as fast as possible and this video is going to help you do that we also have a special guest that appears later in the video his name is bloodx and he's the most successful tier one professional coach in the entire scene he also drops some words of advice in this video and I don't think you can afford to miss it so watch it all the way through what do you think is better to have a calendar or do everything out of order it's good it's always good to have some Str like don't go into the day not knowing what you're going to do let's say you're doing real estates and it's going good you feel like the challenge is there you're you're Duo whoever you're fighting is trying really hard and he's energized and he's in Flow State and you're in Flow State don't stop take advantage of that extend that by another one or two hours if you're on the game and you and you feel like you're playing bad and like genuinely it's not just you like coping or being you know tired for no reason then yeah fine like get off take a 30 minute break come back but if you're if it's going well continue go longer I made a I'll reiterate for the people who don't know but I made a video about this about this Olympic shooter named Lenny Basham and the story goes like where him and his friend they're both shooters Olympic Shooters and they're like yo let's go practice for like an hour and we'll be we'll be done like we we'll go eat lunch then right so then an hour passes his friend's done he comes over and Lenny bash him is still shooting and he goes over and he's like yo why why are you still shooting I thought we said an hour like aren't you done and he's like yeah but I'm [ __ ] I'm popping off he's like yo we're eating lunch later bro like we're not eating lunch right now like I'm popping off like if you're if you're playing better than usual and you feel good don't stop it's a rare occasion so go go crazy it's a general question but I think people don't use their guns enough a really cool thing that you could do is uh when you shoot a wall and you leave it weak don't just like like a lot of people stop shooting at the highest point of the wall if that makes sense like it's good to shoot a wall leave it weak pause for like 3 seconds watch the guy behind the wall cuz you left it weak so it's transparent when he turns cuz a lot of people don't fix weak walls right A lot of people don't pickaxe their own weak walls or repair is kind of [ __ ] like if you pickax your own WE wall it's better um you can just like get free damage guaranteed right so yes use guns more and then be able to do that fake a Reload boys what's good but I didn't even know you could join I said fake a Reload when the wall is low start your shots fake reload like blood side whole bunch of stuff but you want to hop in you want to give him some tips these guys need help man oh I'm just listening bro I'm here to learn should I play aggressive in scrims I mean I I don't think so I think a lot of people play too aggressive if I had to look at the general population they they they just push too much like take scrim seriously like pretend it's fncs really take it seriously like look at oh my God people people need to focus on average placement in scrims they don't do that enough people play scrims to just to play scrims like if you get 15th in in a in a scrim that's what you're going to get that in in game two like habitualized your uh your seriousness too you know it's funny you say that yeah I haven't played with my Duo that I called Heats with after last game of of week two strictly because he gave up in last game because we couldn't call we need like a 20 bomb you know we're not a 20 bomb and I said [ __ ] you and left Discord I haven't spoke to him since cuz like you need to like you actually need to try hard even if it doesn't matter even if you can't win even like you just need to play like we're like it was 90 people up you're not going to get but yes yes yeah and that's that's another Point too it's like scrims scrims are scrims but tournament games are the best scrim like there's nothing there's no better experience than playing a tournament game and let's just say like in scrims like the better players try less because they're already there you know but in tournaments they will do their hardest everyone's trying their hardest yeah yeah scrim scrims are not they're like they're the best thing you can gu so you might as well play them but they're not real they're not as good as as even at in the Pro level like people don't try as hard as they can how do I practice pre-f fires try to don't don't get someone to fake it like try to do it in the middle of a fight like an actual fight like if you get someone to like shoot your wall it's kind of fake like the the whole psychological effect of like trying to do a pre-fire in the middle of chaos is way better but yeah yeah Mar's map can be good but I think doing it in a realistic is also good um yeah like just do it in the middle of chaos uh I think that's better than just like drilling it is it better to make a point goal or a placement goal in a tournament I think the best thing you could do is like [ __ ] all that and just uh do the best you can and where you end up is where you end up cuz you're going to put so much pressure on yourself cuz the way you gain points is not linear you're going to put so much pressure on yourself especially like for example let's say your point goal is like 40 points in a Solo Cup or something right and like first game you get 30 points now you're going to be complacent or first game you get five points and now you're going to be stress just just just do the best you can get the max points even after you call keep going like I these these arbitrary goals are not good I I think you can compare yourself to your old placements after the tournament is finished but when the tournament's running just do the best you can fully King for one turn you get shot for confidence don't like that what do you blood what do you think about keying uh for I guess I guess it depends on the tournament so like I have a completely I have a completely different view set of fortnite I think you should learn I mean like eventually you just need to learn how to play serial kills yeah yeah yeah CU then cuz then you're training different skill sets you're training your awareness like if you need seven kills to make an end game or three kills to make an end game even two kills y it's a crutch you're you're just going to get you're just going to get clapped when you meet good players cuz you're not getting those two three five six seven kills y so training your awareness is playing with less loot playing searge tags and playing zero kills that's how you train awareness yeah like being able to get a kill in a SC it's so troll like cuz or a scrim or a tournament like you're not going to find that in a in a even slightly better Lobby like yeah I mean you often hear me in scrims like during the Veno and quey era like that the insane performance on EU they weren't allowed to use any other guns than a certain amount like other than AR you know they weren't allowed to use SMGs if they killed people they had to split their mats and play with lower mats and scrims like there's no point to put yourself in a scenario that you're not going to be in in Hilo that's just going to like delude yourself you know so like play harder play harder like and when I say that I mean like make make your circumstances harder started doing that with my students like two months ago I think like just split mats like just get rid of your mats if you have cat mats and like a super late Zone just split it like mhm you you could also like look at it and like okay can you convert this into like a top two like without fighting anybody you could look at it that way too but most of the time making it hard is is nice depends on their issues obviously yeah if they always die with mats in their hands then yeah like then you should learn how to convert but if you always die because you can't find a refresh then you should split

the secret science behind winning in fortnite and why some players will always be better than you this is just one of the many news articles that goes over muscle memory and how it can be used to improve dramatically faster in fortnite and most of this is true muscle memory does exist and it's one of the biggest factors to improving at fortnite because muscle memory is essentially the only thing that allows you to improve a specific skill skill and do so almost without thinking like knowing how to Triple edit or knowing how to do multiple build and edit moves in a row or even knowing how to peace control but there are also some misconceptions about muscle memory and I spent over 10 hours researching everything there is about muscle memory how it can be used to dramatically increase your skill level at a very fast rate how it can be used to optimize your practice and submiss conceptions about muscle memory and I'll share everything you need to know in this video in fact scientific research says that skills retained through muscle memory can be performed with up to 25% greater efficiency compared to skills that are practice without focusing on this this means that repetitive actions like building aiming and editing can become almost automatic allowing you to execute these movements f faster so let's say you repeatedly practice quad edits your brain will create and strengthen something called neural Pathways specific to those actions so over time this practice allows you to build and edit faster without needing to consciously think about each step so not only can good muscle memory make you play better but you can also focus on muscle memory in your practice to improve at fortnite faster and I'll talk about exactly how you can do this later in the video but first I think it's important that you fully understand what muscle memory is well whenever a skill is learn the information is stored within the brain region known as the cerebellum essentially meaning the more you practice the skill the more efficient you become even after taking a long break from playing fortnite once you go back your brain is already programmed to play fortnite efficiently because of all the hours you've already put into the game and this is why when you take a one we break for example you'll often come back just as good as you were before you took that break and in some actually in most cases you'll actually play better if you take a short break and come back but only if you haven't took a break in a while to make it easier to understand the more you practice something the more you'll increase your muscle memory this makes getting as many repetitions as you can really helpful to improving fast at fortnite it's why you always see the same Pro at the top of the leaderboard Veno queasy maluka mustache Acorn cold T and setti Cami and I think you get a point they've just simply got more repetitions than you and way more experience on top of knowing the right way to practice and this is why it's so important to get as many repetitions as possible if you want to improve this is because when you repeat actions like aiming building or editing your brain and Muses start to remember these tasks this makes it easier and quicker for you to do them in the future as you keep practicing you'll find that you can react faster and play faster and more smoothly in simple terms the more you practice the better you get because your body and brain get used to what you need to do meaning they can do the actions faster if you want to apply this to your fortnite practice then you want to get the most amount of repetitions for the things you struggle with whether it's something varied like just overall building and editing mechanics or whether it's something specific like edit speed whatever it is you want to be doing as many repetitions of this specific weakness as possible just keep in mind that you also have to improve or at least keep up the other aspects of your game so don't just solely work on one weakness throughout your whole fortnite routine muscle memory is also built through consistency the more consistent you are and the more repetitions you get in the more you will contribute to building a good muscle memory I also think that people done differently which makes the concept of muscle memory even more important because essentially if you understand muscle memory then you would know that you need to increase repetitions and consistency in order to build muscle memory I also want to note that I'm not saying muscle memory by itself is going to make you gopr because at the end of the day you can get as many repetitions of go go to Zone Wars as you want but it's not going to be anywhere near as effective as getting as many repetitions of scrims in or getting as many repetitions of realistic 1 v1's in and stuff like that so you have to combine the concept of muscle memory with other aspects of improving at fortnite like the maps you play and the people you play against and how you practice gradually increasing the difficulty of your practice routine is also one of the best ways to retain muscle memory and just to be able to improve in general just like when you go to the gym you gradually increase the weight to be able to lift more this is known as Progressive overload it's the same with muscle memory in fortnite but in terms of improvement there's no point doing the same thing for one year because what you can do now is a lot more than what you could do one year ago so if you just keep doing the same things over and over again then you're going to reach the skill cap and you're going to stop improving on top of this muscle memory will only allow you to do the things you've already been practicing it will just allow you to do it faster which is why you need to practice in the first place and focus on repetitions and consistency like I mentioned earlier that's how you build muscle memory and that's just how you improve at almost everything in life and that's why it's important you practice the right way it will allow you to improve faster and it will allow you to actually get better instead of staying at the same skill level I have videos on this topic of the right practice but now let's talk talk about another concept of muscle memory that could be holding you back in fortnite competitive as mentioned earlier if you do something consistently your brain will build muscle memory around it whether it's a good or bad thing it doesn't matter and this means if it's a good or bad thing you'll eventually start doing these good or bad things automatically and without thinking it will just become natural to you and this is where the people that do all these flushy edits and flick shots and the bunch of useless stuff in Creative fail to get anywhere in actual games because when you do these bad habits in Creative you start doing these bad habits in real games as well simply because you've pretty much programmed your brain to do this because it's what you constantly do in Creative an example of this is the peanut butter edit in most cases people never actually do this edit properly because they're just trying to be flashy and creative and because they can't do it properly as they've done the same bad edit so many times in Creative this leads them to do the same bad peak in real games which by the way Peaks and reboxing are probably the two main reasons people die in fights but you can break bad habits you just have to refine your muscle memory which you can do by constantly trying to replace the bad habit with a good one so instead of doing the peanut butter edit like this you do it like this instead so although there are positives to muscle memory and although there are ways to use muscle memory to improve there are also some misconceptions about muscle memory specifically when it comes to aim training one of these misconceptions is that you have to stay on one sensitivity or you will get worse at aiming the main reason why people think they have to keep their sensitivity the same is because they are familiar with that sense and this is technically true in itself and is a Justified aspect of improving your aim but the effect is far more shortterm than the other aiming fundamentals if you're unsure of what these fundamentals are by the way they're Mouse control hand ey coordination reactivity reading skills in terms of aim and smoothness there are also so many factors that make it close to impossible for you to memorize how much you need to move your mouse to aim at Targets in game but while playing on a certain sens of itivity you'll gain a general sense of the relationship between the motion of your mouse and what's actually happening in game and you're also building a relationship between how you use the parts of your arm to achieve these Motions like how far you need to move your arm to turn from north to south or from South to East or whatever because of this people will usually get scared off by changing their sensitivity as if they do change their sensitivity they will no longer be familiar with that new sense but it's important to note that the bigger the change in sensitivity is the more you have to adjust how you move your arm but you can develop and refine your ability to adapt to a new sensitivity also there is evidence that shows players constantly changing their sensitivity all without seeing noticeable long-term differences in their ability to aim in fact some people even go as far as to suggesting you to actually change your sensitivity if you're trying to overcome a skill cap me personally I think there are better options that you should try before doing this but the point still stands that people wouldn't be recommending this if it actually affected your aim that much or if it affected your aim long term but the point still stands that you can change your sensitivity without seeing any long-term effects you might see some differences in your aim in the first few days or even weeks but eventually you adapt to that sensitivity but if you want the

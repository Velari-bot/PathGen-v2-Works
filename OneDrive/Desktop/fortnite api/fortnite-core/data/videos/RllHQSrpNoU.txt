seconds to type in and as soon as it does help me out a bunch as always a huge thank you to everyone who uses it with all that said without further Ado let's get into today's video so starting off this video and the first topic I want to discuss is the best game mode the best game mode is a topic that we've been talking about pretty much ever since the arena first came out the best game mode is one of those topics that's really going to depend on the individual visual everybody seems to have a preference for it and nobody seems to think the other game modes are good but honestly guys the game modes really don't have a giant differential when it comes to ranking up and the best move to rank up is honestly to do whatever you're best at if you find yourself being a better solo player and you don't want the possible distractions to come with teammates then run solos if you have one teammate that you play tournaments with or just really like playing with maybe prioritize Duos and if you have a really good team or just a couple of friends to play with or you just enjoy pure chaos then squads might be your best option overall when it comes to picking a game mode don't base it on the amount of rank you can get because truthfully there's no way for us to know for sure what's best for that and when you play each of the three modes and you compare them in terms of how many points you gain or how much rank you gain there's really not much of a difference so my honest advice is to run the mode you enjoy the most or the one you find yourself performing best in and just stick to that one one crucial area to understand is what actually gains you rank since epic doesn't like to tell us for some reason with Arena it was very transparent you knew exactly how to gain points and it was pretty straightforward whereas with ranked mode basically you just play the game and use it rank up or don't sometimes you'll feel like you had a really good game and you'll lose rank sometimes you feel like you had a terrible game and all you got was a bit of placement and for some reason you go up 20 but when it comes to gaining rank it's going to be a combination of rank quests placement and eliminations the first area of this and one that I find pretty underrated is gonna be a ranked Quest this is basically just a quest that's given to you at the start of each match and whenever you can get this done definitely try to the ranked Quest can give you a big boost and potentially turn a gain where you otherwise would have lost points into a pretty solid one the ranked Quest is a very simple Quest usually it's usually like deal some damage with this type of weapon or get eliminations with like headshots or something like that it's usually something that you can very easily attain if you focus on it so obviously don't throw away your game to get the ranked Quest but if it's something realistic then definitely go for it when it comes to placement it's going to be pretty simple placing high in the game is important to avoid losing Rank and dying offspawn is one of the most dangerous things you can do for your rank generally if you're placed within the top 5 or top 10 or anywhere in that area that's going to be ideal and the only huge bump you're going to see after that is like top one top two top three so overall when you're playing you want to set your sights on a good placement like top 10 or something like that and if you do place higher than that then that's just bonus eliminations are also a pretty weird one because they have two roles that seem pretty obscure first off they're worth more as the game goes on meaning endgame kills are the most valuable and they also give more or less depending on your opponent's rank which is largely out of your control unfortunately for example if you get 10 kills on people that all suck versus three or four kills on people that are in like unreal or something like that you'll probably gain about the same amount of points for each so honestly I'd say the best course of action for a normal player is to prioritize getting a couple kills early to secure your drop spot if you need to and then prioritize getting that approximately top 10 area as we discussed before this is a good area where you're probably not going to lose points and you set yourself up pretty well to gain points if you do even better of course in the meantime if you have an isolated fight or something like that you can absolutely take it especially in mid game but you do want to be really really careful guys because a ton of people are third partying this season especially with all the mobility in The Meta after you secure some placement then go ahead and take some more fights if you think they're good ones to go for ideally you're going to get a couple kills early from your drop spot secure some good loot of material drills make it to end game get a couple more kills there and you should gain some really really solid points the next thing I want to talk about is modifying your strategy because you want to keep in mind that modifying your strategy is always going to be an option depending on how you're doing you do have the option of w keying the whole game if you're really good at fighting and that's definitely a really powerful way to gain points if you do it right but once you're in the higher ranks for most people that's probably going to be a struggle what I'm saying here is to feel free to adjust your strategy and play more less aggressive depending on how you're performing and where your rank is going if you've been pushing every single fight you run into and you're still gaining points and you're still going up consistently then absolutely go for that that's the best way for you to rank up if you need to focus on placement and you find yourself dying a lot in early and mid-game fights then prioritize that overall the best way to rank up for you is going to be totally different from your favorite pro or even your own teammates it's a very individual thing we all have our own strengths and weaknesses and it mostly is going to depend on what situations you're actually good at within the game so what I'm saying is the strategy I discussed before is a very good strategy for most you guys but you want to keep in mind that you always have the option to modify it even if you have one basic strategy that you go for if you're feeling particularly good one day you feel like you're winning every fight then you can go ahead and W key if you feel like you're playing terrible and you just want to get some placement points then do that just bear in mind that there's no specific strategy you have to go for within ranked I can give you recommendations But ultimately it's going to come down to how you're playing that day and how you actually prefer to play the game so just bear that in mind and you should be in a pretty good spot moving on from that the next topic I want to discuss is drop spots drop spots are a very big key in ranked because this is ultimately going to set the pace for the rest of your game if you have a really good early game you got a good rotation good good materials you got a couple kills off spawn you're going to be setting up your momentum so good for the rest of the game for the vast majority of people watching hot dropping at one of the new Mythic pois or something like that is absolutely not going to be the move dying off spawn is a huge risk and can lose you a lot of points I'm sure you guys know this so ideally you're going to want to have a couple players at your drop spot but still secure some good looting materials so you want to land at a place where you can get good stuff but you also don't have too many people there another option is to Land close to but not at one of the new pois and then you actually have the option to rotate in there once you get some decent stuff that week in third party and hopefull end up getting the ball usually people take a little bit to get into the Vault so if you take some time to loot up and get some good stuff and then you push them oftentimes you can get an easy third party on a fight or find someone that just got out of a fight get the kill on them and get the Vault it is a risky move but it's less risky than Landing directly in that POI so it's something to consider otherwise though a normal medium population spot is a perfectly good choice and that's what I would recommend for probably 90 of you guys when it comes to ranking up some of the spots that I really like right now are naughty Nets Breakwater Bay and Shady stilts those are just a couple of examples and there are plenty of other pois and even unnamed pois like that which you can land at secure some good stuff get a couple of kills and rotate out however land wherever you like and as long as you're surviving off spawn most of the time and you have some good loot materials to back it then you should be in a pretty good situation it's going to come down to trial and error but I'm sure you'll be able to find something good and if you guys want to see videos about drop spots like the best solo drop spots or Duo drop spots or something like that then definitely let me know if that's something you guys want to see then I can absolutely do that and for the last section of this video guys I want to talk about improving at fighting which is super important for ranking up this season since there are going to be a ton of w here's with all the mobility in the game now I do have a lot of videos about mechanics and fighting and all sorts of stuff like that so I'm not going to go too crazy in depth with everything right here but I do want to give you guys two maps and one extra tip and hopefully this will help you get really really good at fighting and hopefully it'll carry over super well to your ranked games keep in mind that regardless of whether or not you're playing for placement being able to fight is super important because you're gonna have to fight eventually whether that's an early game mid game or end game it's gonna happen so you want to be good at it of course the first thing you want to do is work on your mechanics a good amount one great map for this is Raiders mechanics map V3 this map has a huge combination of Peace control box fights build fight practice editing practice and so much more especially when it comes to ending fights quickly the peace control X Peak section is going to be a super helpful one for you guys the build and box fight sections are also going to be amazing the editing sections and just all this stuff it's a super helpful map it has a huge variety of stuff and overall it should help you guys an absolute ton another map I really like when it comes to direct fighting practice is going to be Ken Bean speed realistic 1v1s these basically put you and your opponent in close range engine forces you to fight quickly and the type of fight you would run into a lot this season essentially one of you spawns inside of a box and the other one is spawned basically flying towards that box and you're meant to fight in close range not use too many materials and essentially treat it like you would in a regular game this really carries over super well to ranked fights and I really like this map I'll go ahead and put the code up on screen to it right now and lastly guys another way to improve at fighting is very very simple which is to play a lot of ranked and focus on playing for fights now I know I told you guys that you want to focus on getting placement points sometimes depending on how you're playing but although it goes against that strategy this is one of the best ways to improve the game and get more comfortable with fighting which will make you better at ranking up long term keep in mind that even if you have to sacrifice your rank for a little bit and play for a lot of fights and get better at fighting if you find yourself really struggling in fights and this may be something you need to do in order to level up your gameplay sometimes you gotta make sacrifices and honestly there's really no benefit to ranking up if you're just playing for placement and you're not able to get any kills and you're just getting destroyed every time you fight so if you find that being the case then focus on playing for fights and if you're rank adjusts so be it you can always get your rank back eventually by playing optimally but if you find yourself really having a big weakness for fighting then definitely try to play for more fights and hopefully although it's not the quick way to rank up that should help you in absolute turn and ultimately in the long term It's Gonna Make You way better at the game but with all that said guys that's gonna wrap it up for today's video on how to rank up super fast in fortnite chapter 4 season 4. overall by following all the tips in this video you should

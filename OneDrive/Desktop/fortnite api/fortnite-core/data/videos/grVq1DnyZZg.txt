yo what's going on guys I'm going to give you a bunch of tips and tricks on how to get better at crossair placement crossair placement is a much needed thing if you want to get better improve at fortnite but I'm going to show you an example what a bad crossover placement would look like like that like you're exaggerating your edit like pretty bad and you don't really need to do all that movement whatever all you can just do is a simple move it like like that see what I mean but without further Ado let's get into the first tip of the video okay for the first tip I have for you guys is to load into this Raider uh 464 map we'll have the code in the description that you guys could just copy in or type in whatever but once you're in go to the free build section you'll see it at like the beginning part go to free build go over in here and go to Island speed um I would recommend clicking 8 or6 or 0.9 if you know you're pretty fast but let's go with to show you guys what to do so I recommend doing the uh double edit crossair things for like uh 5 to 10 times at least just to get used to it but you could do it as how long as you want but just get used to that and you could also do like an example of a bad crossair placement on walls would be something like this see look I'm just swiping it around not really getting it but you could just see look all that little motion for that same edit that you need to do instead of going like that you know messing it up or just huge circle you whatever you just need to make a little circle but that's really all I have for this tip um let's get into the next one okay for the next tip I have for you guys is to go into your settings it doesn't matter if your controller keyboard or Mouse but if you keep messing up like the double edits or the wall edits like you're going like this you feel like your sense is too fast I recommend lowering it I'm playing like mid sense I mean it feels perfect for me but people with like more fast sense I see like really don't have the best Crosshair placement but it really just depends on the player but because you can still have fast and still be pretty good at Crosshair placement but that's just an advice I have if you don't really uh get it down that quick but yeah let's get into the next tip okay for my third and final tip I just recommend you guys to just like load into any 1 V one map it doesn't really matter you can stay in this map and just to free build you know you got to practice like if you don't really practice you're not going to get better at it but I recommend practicing like um this for like 10 to 15 minutes but once you're done with that you should uh automatically start seeing improvements like from like a week but yeah that's how I got my crossair placement better and Hope you guys enjoyed the video and have a great rest of your day

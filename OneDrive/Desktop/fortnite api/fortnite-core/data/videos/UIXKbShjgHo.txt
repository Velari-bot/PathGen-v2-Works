guys if you're a zero earned player you need to watch this video in its entirety and actually i'm gonna recommend something i recommend that you take notes because often times you're gonna watch this entire video you're gonna take in oh that's cool this is a good lesson this is a really cool tip and then you're gonna remember nothing so i really recommend write notes down take in the information but more importantly retain it so that you can actually go ahead and apply in the next tournament so watch this video through take notes retain the information and i hope you guys enjoy the mattress three tells a story usually i can figure out what the issue is right from there um the fact that you got 470 and you is already good enough so that's i'm happy with this placement believe it or not i don't know if you're you're used to higher or lower replacements like is this a average or a good placement for you guys good second place eleven e limbs six place four limbs twelfth place is a mistake like this is tough this is this is what you don't want this is this is a like if you let's let's actually consider we'll do the calculation how many points is that that's what we need to know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten plus two that's 12 points for 23 minutes so it's not that bad but usually you get way more with with this sort of game but we need to figure out what the issue is here this is this is one of the games where um you waste a lot of time for the points that you get same with this one 11 minutes for 38 that's probably like a few points not even actually that's zero that's zero points all right uh this game as well and then this game as well your issue is nothing more than the fact that you do too many games that's it so there's there's quite literally not i wouldn't say literally nothing but uh maybe there's opportunity in these games to like go for a top two right we really have to look into more detail to figure it out uh but i really feel like four games lost where you don't get that many points it is the issue i really do think so so we'll take a look we'll look at them i don't think we need to watch this game yes you might have won but that's such a minor improvement that's like three four points difference uh and so we'll look at sixth and then onwards okay so i'm curious if so if this game is a situation where one of you guys die early it'd be really good for i actually would be excited because what that means is uh you only have one issue which is someone dies before moving so if you just fix that issue suddenly you have three games fixed instantly it's a good thing i'm hoping it's the same mistake because the worst thing that could happen to you is uh you run into six different mistakes in a tournament that means you have six mistakes to fix but if you die to the same thing multiple times then it's look easy right now you guys are fine it's only four zone though so okay so this game you make it to moving so this is different and you guys are actually pretty stuck so i like it yeah this game is looking forward let's skip my biggest worry and uh looking at the mini map i know it's not an uh an issue but we don't know that is someone following your your why am i yeah it doesn't end up happening right but it's scary so i actually would not wait here you could try this for like two seconds and then as soon as it stops working you just go right because this is a very common path people are rotating into half up they're gonna follow you and and you might if they land on top of your head here it's over so after this attempt we just need to go just ignore him you guys wait here way too long so think about it this way rotates in general especially um half af rotates especially half f13 because half i rotate so let me show you this so let's say i have um let's say i have this let's say this is a third zone and then fourth zone shows here okay just as an example yeah people are gonna come in from all directions meaning it's not concentrated okay so like they can rotate it in from every direction however the problem with half-half so let's say for a second this is 47 uh and then half of shows here affect everyone's coming from a single direction or not single direction but like the same kind of direction right which means it's kind of like a tsunami so if you if you rotate halfway and then pause everyone behind you is gonna it's like a traffic jam a car crash like it's bad they're gonna run into you right and it's really likely that they run into you so this this situation even though i know it's not a problem because of the mini-map but mini-map's kind of cheating uh um it makes me nervous like if i didn't have the mini-map i would be very scared so you guys should have left that much earlier you could try it but the attempt should take five seconds maximum it should be quick okay it didn't work move on this is good i'm rather using brick by the way because brickery farm is much stronger than wood free farm in this season or in this chapter in general and you guys in general just don't have a lot of work this is fine so you're not in the best situation which is the fact that um your mats are not amazing so so that that stems from uh overbuilding or or using a lot of mats throughout the game because i noticed in ha in fourth zone you didn't have the mass mass either so i don't think it's just this rotating problem it's it's multiple rotates that contribute to the bottom but from some games honestly you don't have a choice like i'd rather spend mats and be live than uh save mats and die so um i'm i'm happy that you guys are building because a lot of uh newer players are amateur players or people that are like even intermediate they they they under build right so the best solution is over build and learn how to get impacts that's better i'm actually happy here at this stage because a lot of people are under a bill because they don't ought to get killed and so then they just die sometimes unnecessarily this is good it makes following okay so i see so i see an issue what am i what am i hesitating about you guys see it or not yes yes let's talk about why he's popping a mini i just heard the second he's healing right now he's popping a big and then we should wait we need to wait until he finishes so i don't know what the columns are like so i'm not necessarily saying it's linux fault i think it's both of you guys who's fault okay i think so you guys have to coordinate in order to figure out when you should leave right and usually as an igl what i do is this this is what the conversation looks like i'm about to rotate are you ready and i do not leave i do not edit until i hear the yes right and then you know what i do after that and i'm not joking this is what i do and i've heard some pros do it some pros don't do it but i some pros don't need to do it that's why they don't do it but some pros um what they do is they do three two one i'm going right and so it mentally prepares your teammate to press w so you can look and even so let's say i'm the camera let's say reuter is the camera let's say he's like right here even this could be better right you should quite literally be running together like almost side by side if like that's the most ideal situation okay but you know if he's like right here that's fine this is pretty close this is good enough okay but this is way too split because let's say i'm in a box like somewhere up here and i'm staring at you guys i just see one person going so what does that mean i know the second guy's coming so what am i going to do i'm going to take your teammate look here the guy's coming and then as soon as he shows he's dead yeah but if you guys are close together i can't react to that i can't set up the double spray with my teammate that's the idea because you guys are so split it gives more reaction time uh window for other people and it becomes easier to use hp it's a perfect example because if you guys are actually together here i don't think you lose either as much hp or hp at all and the reason why this is significant even if you have heals is because in order to heal you have to you have to spend mats you have to you have to build a base and and also you just lose yields in general not necessarily and you could have saved it's really really important that you don't lose hp on your rotates so yeah this is what i recommend okay the conversation just just to reiterate are you ready yes okay three two one i'm going okay that's what i do quite literally every single time and when i the first time i did that my teammates specifically told me that it was a good thing and i should continue doing it because it became very easy for them to stick with me okay what are you thinking at this point based on your situation what do you need to do what is your win condition in this game why why grapple your win condition okay i i don't agree i don't think so what do you need before uh like third moving let's say so here's a question can you get to third moving probably yeah yeah if you get a refresh yeah i'm talking about with your current current loot i don't think so yeah not at all yes your mats are horrible exactly mats are really really bad you so your win condition is you desperately need a kill and a significant one like you need a kill that gives you mats that's what you need and so the reason why it's important to identify your win condition before you start playing moving zones is because if you don't know what your win condition is you'll just calmly tarp without looking for a single thing and that in this situation that's my guess i think that's what's gonna happen but if you know what your win condition is then both of you guys will be focused on trying to like spray this guy down for example right and you start working on it maybe you'll pickaxe the floor claim edit three squares and then double spread that's probably what you should do and you should pre-claim this box underneath he falls in you get a kill and there you go and let's just quickly see how many macias he has 56 plus 15 because of siphon that gives you 70 bills for free if this works but it will only work if you actually attempt it or at least it would only have a chance of working if you actually attempt it so the problem is my guess is that we'll go we'll go a little bit until without getting killed and uh you know we'll be very low mass but i think you should start looking for kills much earlier you're looking for a kill here good good very open here this is the only issue i'm worried about we stopped tarping all together but just because you didn't get sprayed or hit doesn't mean it's correct so just watch after that yeah yeah so this is this is a this is a mess this is very scary so here's what happened you guys got a kill uh i'm gonna be extremely honest it was lucky and i you guys can let me know if you disagree like if you think it's not lucky let me know because i i personally think it was lucky which is fine okay because sometimes lucky stuff happens and we should take advantage of it but the problem is if you run this game back ten times eight out of the ten games you will not get a refresh why because you guys aren't looking for one does that make sense you're not actively looking for one so if you guys watch a pro or like even eu pros or whatever i mostly watch any esprit because i'm from minnesota but i end up like like watching them more often uh but essentially what when when they're in this situation they end up like looking for kills on like four different teams by now right they they attempt it so like let's say let's say that previous example let's let's go back to that previous example right i pointed out where i i saw that team and i wanted to spray them down okay let's go back there oh this is fine okay back here let's say let's say we attempt to spray them down okay let's say it doesn't work that's okay because we still have mats to try like three more times okay but if we use all our mats without trying once we will never find an impact unless it literally comes to us by accident and we don't want that because we want to be the type of team who actively knows how to go for an impact and usually in my personal opinion it's it's it's through the method of awareness checking which basically means attempt something and if it doesn't work first try try someone else like go for a different hat because essentially like the problem with going for the same team like four different times is on the second third and fourth attempt they know what you're trying to do but then it's not worth it anymore because they're going to be ready on the first attempt that's where you have the element of surprise and they might fall for it that's what you want to do but in this specific case i don't think we should uh so yeah you realize it wasn't working and we continue the problem here is you if i just stare at you for a little bit with uh not height because heights distracted so they're not going to look at you but someone else maybe there's a tarp here just quickly look how it exposed you guys even this team let's say this guy doesn't get sprayed down luckily he did because now he's distracted he pumps you guys in the back game's over this is very very scary what you guys are doing here so we need to tarp the problem is you don't have master type so i understand why you're hesitating right you're very scared to use bills because you don't have a lot which is why it was so important to go for this attempt back here right we need we need like the the the low mat situation must be solved much earlier than this point in the game it has to be because right now you guys are really low on that and it's getting scary essentially the point is you don't want to wait until the last moment because let's say you have three builds each okay and then you go for that impact where you're trying to like drop someone down let's say he's aware what do you do then it's over because you don't have time to go for a second impact like just like now now that last attempt that you did didn't work and and now you don't have uh matching time so it becomes very strong what's really important is as soon as you realize what your win condition is you start going for impacts then okay we need an impact we're not going to get into third or fourth moving before uh we get an impact because we just don't have the mass to do so okay that's how you should think okay let's continue watching the game because we do get this kill which is fine let's see how many matches he has a lot of mats okay thank god kill him one small note that i'll make is uh it's hard to get impacts with a stereotarp and i also do not recommend stair tarpon uh when there's a team right here so if there's a team to your bottom diagnose you don't stereotype or at least you try not to um and the reason is is because if he sprays your floor you can't double layer it like you can't place the cone because of the stair so it's really awkward he can he can phase you down it's very scary so um don't i mean i think in this case it's okay because you're fast harping meaning you're full sprinting while tarping and so most likely he will not catch you fast enough but let's say you're all there at the front of zone and you're still targeting that's when it's scary because you're gonna have to stand on the same floor for multiple seconds right here it's okay right here it's starting to get scary good perfect yeah so this this is good it holds max what should you do in this situation it's very obvious where sorry front yeah yep exactly you give grapple there because you both have double grapple so yeah you do need to go look down front and i would i would not play this game in a situation where um you you you grapple box the reason i wouldn't is because you don't you still don't have enough mats to to get top to um with grapple box do you still need another kill because you have you have 50 builds each okay so in my personal opinion i just say grapple forward land low ground claim low ground the reason i know low ground is free even though i don't like let's say i'm in your box i can't see everything like i can't go drone free and see the map why do i know low ground's free without looking because it's that side yes exactly good good good good zone pulled that side right which means front side is low you don't even have to look so just grapple immediately so you're really waiting for the balloon the problem with this delay is because it's zone has shown for a long time low ground is gone by now right yeah because that's why it's important to instantly go as soon as it shows right so we'll go back very quickly i know you guys understand the point but i'll show you exactly the moment that we should react and i think it's i genuinely think it's more important than reloading it on right now you need to go edit go all right the problem is we waited too long and someone else has taken it the reason why i'm confident that you guys will get it because you have grapple like so most people what they will do in the situation is they'll edit down and run to the spot but because you have grapple you'll beat them as long as you react fast enough at this point because low ground is gone i would now change your game plan into grapple boxing even though it's not ideal you grab a box and you still need an impact that's what i would do that's your game plan could follow this tarp it's not bad i would actually i'd actually potentially do it because again one condition you need an input you might not need it now but opportunities like this could be good waiting for your grapple okay uh the pattern that i'm seeing in general across all your games okay it's not just uh this game thing is that you guys need to realize that smacking on a wall is not scary as long as you know when to stop like going for a kill it doesn't mean you're jumping in their box you're just you're just aggressing their wall that's all yeah right so you can stop if you know if you feel like they noticed right but you should you should attempt things more often you should do what awareness checking is you should awareness check other people more often right so this type that i saw is a good attempt a good opportunity because as soon as you as soon as they notice let me go back because this is actually really important because this will teach you like a life lesson about moving zones in general if you go into that tarp and they notice you all you have to do is place a single wall break out right and grapple and you're good yeah right but let's say they don't notice you let's say there's a universe where they don't notice you now you have two kills and now you have the god vats which means now you can just grapple box the rest of the game and you you've won the game you're good you don't need anything else that's why it's really really important to recognize what your win condition is and play that way okay that's uh unfortunately i didn't go back far back enough i don't think right yeah i don't think i did regardless this tarp that's what i was talking about you saw it earlier this is what you should have followed and my personal opinion because i don't think it's that risky and yes i know you guys are backstone but again i don't think it's that risky because as soon as they realize you just voice wall and break the other side good very happy with this very very happy because again like i said if it doesn't work just place a single wall and it doesn't work meaning they noticed before you actually saw anyone and then you just you just continue uh grappling dappling after this all right don't you still need to kill at this point sometimes that happens sometimes you'll get a kill like an impact and then they don't give you that anymore it's very normal okay keep going i'm glad you didn't go for that it pulls again that side another opportunity to potentially take a look on yeah yeah because i just i don't need to look i just know so that's why it's super important because a lot of people don't do that a lot you know what a lot of people do is they they end up looking they're like oh it pulled can we take a look on i'm gonna look okay it's clear i'm gonna go now that takes forever but if you guys are smart enough to realize that hey i can just take it now then you should because the match that you have is good enough to clean i honestly think if linux had 10 builds and you still take it because you'll get the impact on logan it's so guaranteed if you could still take if you recognize yourself your choice don't get hit that hard all right or dies okay so let's go back 1250 [Music] of course the replay completely skips it i i mean i think part of the issue honestly i actually think this is the issue is uh he needs to block himself when he grapples so that he doesn't slide down because part of the reason why you were why you were bought is because you are not in a good position like if you end up boxing or placing a wall to stop your your your slide then you'll be in a position where you can just make one box and chill and then regroup with linux essentially every time you make a grappa rotate this is the order of operations okay you box okay you don't even look for teammate first a lot of people get killed because of that right you box so that you have the luxury you have the you're able to relax you're able to chill so that you can actually find your teammate the people that end up uh grappling and then let's say they don't know where the teammate is without boxing they just keep looking for their teammate well now you're just running out in the open for like 5 10 seconds that's all it takes for you to die you should box look for teammate i found teammate then go to them that's what you do it's okay if it takes a little bit longer because sometimes that's necessary we need to take our time but overall like actually pretty good game right and i think it's because of the fact that you know and i like you you did go for impact you follow the type you went for impact what i'm suggesting is you need to push harder in that front you need to you need to go for more because the the one impact that got you 70 builds or whatever was very lucky and in an alternate universe if you want to be consistent you can't play like that you need to go for kills proactively you need to create the opportunities yourself not bad really good okay a little bit unfortunate because what i would suggest in this situation yeah like look look how many look how much men missed here okay no that's that's bug that's bug sorry that's a [ __ ] so you have way less but you have double flop i will not start running yet you have way more time than you think and this guy just chilled like i don't know what he's doing but he's the one but yeah i would stick back a little bit further like even hike and decide to see you if they wanted to maybe but i would just wait a little bit longer that's all yeah the one guy in storm is a little bit unfortunate so do you have a visual audio on yeah yeah so yeah if you're paying attention to that specifically you'll see essentially most footsteps being in front of you and then in your back left you'll see one footstep and so that should that should speak you up because it couldn't have been height because heights should be also in front of you usually because they're not tanking and so that one footsteps should scare you you'll see it at some point yeah like right here it should scare the [ __ ] out of you so you should have noticed this guy is my point and if you're dead you maybe you fight him and you win maybe you would i don't know it really depends on your shot but yeah a lot of lessons are in that game it's a mouthful we'll go back but if you see your name again okay we found our first problem so i i usually usually when i say uh four games are bad that's not the only issue okay because sometimes your six places or your tenth places or whatever like the games that are decent where you get 15 points or so uh could totally be top twos totally and top two is what you want because that's where you should be satisfied anything below that you should you should find out okay what's the issue because honestly you should give yourself leeway to mess up games does that make sense like if you have four messed up games sometimes you can still qualify messed up games if all your other games are insane because sometimes that's how pros call pros will have you know really bad games and then have really really really good games and then call from that so that that's another option so i think this is your your part of the issue you probably do solo clutch uh up to six but if you if you guys had both of you guys alive then you know that's what you think so let's talk about what what was like how did you guys die we got to figure that out [Music] yeah at this point raiders alive skip to [Music] your mats are decent shield mismatches something to fix you probably do fix that oh yeah someone sneaks up on you i was gonna say you're i i think the guy if you lost and then i thought they wouldn't push up mm-hmm yeah you guys are not that high up so you can't be sitting out like this like i'll show you okay so where are they they're over here somewhere right yeah you guys are not that high right so they could quite literally place two ramps and get up to you and then pump right no problem so if you guys are like up here where my camera is then sure you could be a little bit like more careless but here this is way too scary yeah i i would respect this morning for sure that's the issue and obviously linux is just gonna maybe you can play yeah so it stems from that so let's see so here here's the thing right if you want to solve this problem very specifically okay like what i mean is like what could you specifically do to not run into this issue again you guys have two people in a duo correct so one of you guys needs to be constantly staring the other way so first first thing is the only way you actually respect them is you should be scared of them you should be scared of something like this happening so you should your instinct should tell you okay we're we're not really that safe right now that's the first thing because if you if you feel unsafe then you'll start being more careful okay uh and what i the reason why in this case let's say i was in your game instead the reason why i would feel unsafe is because you're not that high up so someone could easily ramp up right so like these guys could easily ramp up and do something so that's the first thing the second thing is um uh when when you when you guys are are up here maybe like i don't i don't even think you should go up more all you need to do is have one person dedicated looking this way or anyone else like i don't know if there are more people just look this way right just look at the the threat and the other person who usually would be the igl can focus on the rotate both of you guys do not need to be looking this way because then you have a blind spot behind you that makes sense good job just just literally assign one person to stare in the direction of the threat and then you're good just watch your flank i don't think we need to watch the soul clutch because the only reason you guys have six is because you have to solo clutch so if you guys uh fix this issue uh and and not lose a person then you're good do you guys feel like your positioning was the issue or the aim was the issue i don't really know anymore like uh i mean we could find out ourselves in other games if you search in those games as well but um actually okay yeah so if that's the case then uh i think the raider has an ar map so you should practice that or maybe spotting people yeah you feel like your positioning was fine like obviously it's not like i'm not i'm not saying you're claiming that it's like number one like it's the best but it doesn't seem to be the limiting factor it doesn't seem to be like the reason why um you're missing out on here yeah so i i i think that was the case as well like at least in that zone your position was really good like you could see a lot so seems like that wasn't the issue where are you guys okay go here maybe there's nobody so i mean i mean i i see what you mean but side jumping is always a risk always a little bit because essentially what you're doing is you're you're you're going into a new layer blind right and i so i actually had this issue myself when i was playing like back in the day uh and i remember i literally quite i remember the first time i died to a side jump and i realized immediately right after that that side jumps are not encouraged you should not side jump you should just stay on your lair once you own your layer like once you place a couple of bills you can look up check then go so like side jumping is the equivalent of changing a lane without checking your blind spot it's it's quite literally the same thing okay so like imagine someone's above you on the layer and then you just jump up like of course you might get fun you know some games some games you won't get pumped but doesn't mean it's right yeah yeah we're just rolling a dice for no reason we're putting ourselves away so that's why i think it's not unlucky that's why i really think it's something to be fixed and uh when i when i pg for example i love side jumps so it actually took me a while to take that out of my my habits because i knew it was something especially because it's hard for a teammate to follow as well it's not easy for me to follow we're not even a side jump in this case but you just hopped up a layer here double check one more time yeah yeah it was just like that's a guy too but it's oh yeah just a rift to blind blindfold you go for it uh did you watch this no this it's very obvious to me that that was the reason that we get 12. yeah yeah like yes there's multiple reasons but the mistakes are usually in layers so if you fix the first one then you'll never have to solo clutch in the first place but then that's why the first one is the most important okay next game i think this is the 38th yeah i can explain it real quick we didn't have much loot so we wanted to kill someone in this game yeah yeah we had enough games so we just double killed someone we didn't want to waste time yeah i'll let you know if it's justified so are you saying in this specific game you didn't have enough loot like you didn't like to loot that yet yeah yeah yeah what is your loophole is it you you guys land here right yeah yeah and uh you're saying you looted all of this and this is the end yeah yeah yeah it's pretty unlucky actually and the team on top right now yeah we didn't know somebody was on top because they didn't then yeah yeah getting games here okay in this case i agree with the push like whatever team you push i mean we'll see because because okay yeah this team and this team is obviously wrong for sure i agree uh so there's two things that we have to consider the first thing is should you push a team like should you look for a push at that point i agree with now we have to talk about whether i agree with pushing the team that you did end up pushing maybe you could have fought a different team okay so let's see that all right i do agree that you need to take a fight or find some empty loophole that could fix your situation because your situation can't play it especially now so okay let me put it this way the situation you're in is really bad and yes you didn't want to waste time so i don't actually care if you die here because you can use q again so it's fine this is your best bet i actually agree with this like if you die here it's not a throw whatsoever okay so if you want to know how to win this fight let's watch one more time i just saw the whole thing in forex for me okay who's winning so far [Music] at the moment i guess we because we have an advantage because you attacked them and yeah well but what about reuters hp yeah yeah the question is did he take this damage just now or earlier i think it was there uh earlier okay so yeah exactly so this is the thing you have to keep track of because it's not it's in my opinion it's even because of the like reuters 100 and then he also got cracks so like it's pretty even you guys are slightly above in hp but it's so minimal especially quality so that i would say you're even however you guys are motivated to push because you don't have heals and so if you don't want them to heal right yeah yeah maybe writer can throw a keg down and just so i think that's what he should do is just keep it a distance throw the keck down and just spam ar and help linux that way but you're still helping while healing he's adding some pressure and linux very slowly takes his fight yeah yeah so you i mean you won the trade but now you guys are equal hp but he's healing right now nice yeah i like this if you can get if you can if you can survive until the magic gets off i'm sure leonard's calm down yeah then then it's actually decent overall it's tough because this this this is exactly the problem that you were telling me which is uh you do damage and they do damage back so nothing happens so do you believe that's okay i'm seeing a lot of mistakes so several things let me go even deeper in terms of micro okay so i can tell you very specifically what's going on so the problem is exactly what i said before the problem is you're doing damage but you're taking damage back so nothing ends up happening but if you end up doing damage without taking damage then you then you'll start to start winning the fight okay so going that was a risk he could have shot i don't know why he didn't yeah so several things you need to very concretely like pick up pick a floor and and go for it okay so if you want to go for this there's not a safe angle why because they can edit wall edit wall and then shoot you so this is the problem so what i would do is find a nice right hand so place a wall here where you're looking edit this and then claim this floor and start working on this right hand like where you're sitting on this piece right here and you're working around the right right because right now there's no right hand peak at all and so this is scary so i would just ignore this piece and work on the right and just fully claim this that forces especially i'm talking the cone too that forces him to get out of this box and move into this one and so then you have two options you can start you can continue working on this side and take this wall and then work on like the right hand here or then you can come back to this floor because he's forced into this box then he doesn't have a nice right hand right now because right now this angle right here for him is really good it's a nice right hand on him yeah so that's what you don't want and i'm not saying they're playing it right either like they're playing it pretty bad because like he doesn't he's not fully abusing the right hand here right but we don't need to give them unlike advantages so someone needs to be working on this floor absolutely this needs to be gone already oh yeah but give yourself the right angles that's what i that's what i would say yeah this is good so the only reason you took damage there is because you double swung on the on the thing so i actually think double swinging is fine but mentally you were not ready for him to open that's the problem if i go back but like you can you can swing as fast as you want as long as first of all you should stand a little bit further back you should stand like right here and just by the way to make it easier you don't actually have to move once you stand in the right spot like it's okay like just to make it easy for yourself and sometimes i literally do this i'll literally stand on the spot and just let go of wasd so it's easier for me um so i stand here don't move swing as fast as you want because as soon as you see the edit you can just reset this wall and you'll be safe because as soon as he edits he has the gun swap delay and so as long as you reset fast enough you'll be fine okay and same thing here the only problem here is you are committed to the double swing mentally not ready for him editing so when he did this you were not ready to reset like so here's the question can he shoot right now okay no you can't why not because he's pulling out his gun yeah so that means you have a window of time to actually reset this wall that's my point right it's that like now he can shoot not even like like very very slowly like you have to pull out his gun right and that's the animation so you have time you can literally stare at him for like half a second and then he shoots so as long as you're mentally ready because resets are instant right resets can happen very very fast as long as you're ready you should be uh able to reset that wall fast enough so that's the key that's what i would recommend is one year double swinging just be mentally ready to to react with the reset and it is possible especially if you play on your own region and your ping is decent you should be able to do it because in box fights and i'm washed i do it all the time and so pro players do it even more than i do but that's the key don't trade with him when he edits because he'll shoot first and if he's actually good he could block your shot but he's not yeah he needs to i mean it's a really hard actually which way did he flip his ramp because it was such an easy uh it's such an easy block yeah yeah so let's see how did he flip this yeah okay wrong flip this is why he sucks okay so so if he if he uh if he flips his his ramp instead of this way if he flips it this way like from here to there then he actually has a reset right so that's really important he messed up if he does that then you don't actually end up trading back with him your instinct or your reaction to him editing will pull out my shotgun what i'm recommending is reset wall hold because he's going to break it by shooting and then as soon as you hear the shot and you edit shoot yeah yeah right because if you uh if you just pull out your pump you're walking into the situation that you want to avoid which is trading damage because if he plays it properly you will never get the shot off if he you happen to shoot after him like well after him because of his mistake and he didn't set up his ramp properly then you you were able to do damage my point is if he's a better player you never get that damage often that's all yeah okay good if you guys have questions let me know about that whole situation yeah now that was a small section by the way there were other mistakes too but they were very similar to what i was pointing out so the the general guidelines are find good angles right eliminate like find the right angles first like you use the angles where you have an advantage and and just take those pieces limit their space by uh by um taking the the boxes that they're they have access to right so the the box that i recommended was really good because you have a right hand on it and then once you get him out of that box he no longer has a right hand on the other floor that you were working on on the left but that would be really good because he can't stand in that box then and then that whole situation was one small part of it but if both of you played the way i suggested which is take pieces but be ready to reset then you will be much better off in that fight overall uh okay so what do we think is the issue main thing like what should we focus on the most two things that i see so play smart aggressive what i mean is don't just don't just pick a team and fight check if they're aware like start aggressing on them if they're not aware continue if they are aware you can choose to back up if you want to that's it because theoretically if you follow that to a t where you know when to back up if they notice then you'll never die that's one mistake play a little bit more aggressive second mistake that contributed to two to three games of uh six 12 cent [ __ ] was someone's dying before moving okay and that's something you need to fix and yes it's it happens to be because of various different reasons but it needs to be fixed regardless i'm naming an issue not the reason it happens i mean we discussed the reason it happened so one game it was because someone snuck up on your height another game it was because of a side jump and another game etcetera etcetera etcetera okay but if you fix that you'll solve several games where you had to solo clutch where you didn't necessarily have to like it was very easy to fix all you have to do is fix that one mistake that caused that depth and it should be pretty easy to be consistent as a duo solo clutch should be a backup option not a uh a plan okay so solo cut should come because something messed up you're trying to you're trying to fix the game because you already messed up but if you just fix the mistake from the beginning then you won't have to solo clutch at all but we'll do it like this right so you'll ask all the questions at once right and then um what i want you to do is like i'll write it down right and then i'll i'll answer them one by one we'll do it that way uh-huh okay okay first question is um if if late game arena is in-game is there any uh big advantage you can get out of lighting game arena yeah so how should you practice it optimally okay continue exactly exactly and then the second question is loadout if you find a golden pistol is it worth to carry in your in your mp slot or [Music] i'm rotating like more i don't i don't have any plan of rotates i'm doing it like what did i say that um you're kind of freestyling it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i hear you okay so freestyling okay properly yeah but i don't i don't know what to look out for got you got you okay next question so only trading equal damage can't find the opening to start winning and like you'll never do like a hundred and they do like 20 to you like you know yeah i hear you so yeah that is actually really easy to fix but let's keep going uh do you have other questions yeah yes yes one and as solos if i have three med kits or one what should i carry three med kits versus one madness got you okay yeah and only in solos i got you so i'll screen share just so you guys can see my notepad here um and we'll talk about it okay so answers yeah okay so we'll talk about uh all questions in detail so first thing is if lake marina is released how should you practice it optimally uh so obviously the first thing that i would do um if possible like let's say your duo was on then i would i would absolutely play with your duo um in my personal opinion there will be some areas where you can actually just improve from synergy right like you'll get more and more comfortable with your duo like if you ask me right now do i think both of you guys are as comfortable as possible with each other i would say no i think most people can like most people have room to improve with their duo um in terms of calms in terms of uh like the way i like to think about it is there are some duos in the world and i've personally experienced this um where you don't even need to communicate something because you both know what to do and you both know that you put your your teammate is going to follow up on it does that make sense like you're so comfortable with each other that it's almost telepathic where you know something like you've you've seen this situation before maybe it was in a scrim or like some 2v2 and you you both know exactly what you need to do so i would say play the first thing is uh play with duo uh when possible uh and the other thing is this this is what i would do you need to push as many people as possible to create uh like problems like create engagements create uh action do not just play for endgame however it's sort of like a um it's sort of like a a a meter like you should not push all the way to the point where you die push as hard as possible without dying okay so for that that's different for some people so if if you're not a complete pro player you can't just like suicide push like you can't just push like really really hard you kind of need to push maybe uh like with some leeway okay just to make sure you don't die um and you know if you're really really really really good at fighting then yes absolutely you can just push all the way and you'll be fine um so that is a thing so i would say push aggressively because it's lake in marina and you have nothing to lose so it's okay to make mistakes here and you should you should encourage yourself to make mistakes that's the thing that i would uh suggest okay push aggressively but do your absolute best to not die okay this will help you uh play proactively in an end game and help you trying to understand like how hard can we push without dying and then once you know what level that is then you can sort of do the same thing in a real game right because you'll learn like oh if i just jump in this guy's box without doing any damage it doesn't work okay cool now that i know that i won't do it anymore right it's so much better to die several times trying and then pull back rather than not push anyone at all and then learn nothing right so that's what i would recommend just push a lot because there's nothing to lose in like your marina okay next thing is um uh timing not necessarily time your fights but uh encourage yourself to end a fight fast when you have an advantage okay so let's say you don't have an advantage let's say you're fighting someone and there's no damage dealt there's nothing crazy no advantage whatsoever i don't expect you to end up and that fight in 30 seconds because they can just be weird and never peak you or like just never open and things like that so i i it's okay if it takes long if you don't have an advantage however if one of you crack the other guy for free and you don't take any damage then yes you should be pushing really hard and trying to end up by quickly because other people will also hear that sheer crack and they'll they'll be interested they'll want to take part in the fight so that's the key thing is is try time almost time your fights like not literally but like make sure you end it quickly when you do find that opening okay because in general with fighting that is a good habit to to encourage yourself to do is to end it quickly um and in general overall like with lake marina is understand you have nothing to lose so don't worry about doing crazy things it's not a waste of time um so try to do as many crazy things as possible learn what doesn't work and then remove that from your options okay because then you'll essentially you'll push as hard as possible in a real game without dying that's that's the most effective place to be in my personal opinion and you'll you'll essentially learn what options you have and what what options are out of bounds that's what you want to do okay next question if you have a golden pistol is it worth to carry in my personal opinion the only situation where that's worth to carry is i'm sure you understand the the scenario where if you have a og and then an smg in a duel the reason why you hold that in the first place is because you guys can exclusively have different ammo types you technically have more ammo um so in duos i would do that if you don't have an smg but you haven't like ar or maybe double air because then one person can hold golden golden pistol and then use light light ammo in solos i don't think so i think smg's just straight up better so that's my that's my thing so if you have aug smg or that those sort of guns already then just hold those those are just better in my personal opinion and also i mean there is a preference thing so if you find yourself being good with the golden pistol and you really really really like it for some reason then sure you don't have to listen to me but um my personal opinion is it's not it's not that good compared to the loadout options that we have number three if you're in a customer or a cash group round and you don't have a plan for rotate so you're free styling okay so here's the thing about rotates you should have some initial plan but you i'm sure you'll recognize this but sometimes you'll have situations where you can't see further ahead so i'll draw a picture just so you understand yeah the if i show you let's say this is this the current zone like this okay and then you're this is fourth zone let's say this is fourth zone and then half half shows right here but you're you're currently right here okay but let's say there's enemy boxes like let's say there's a two boxes right here a duo yeah and you can't see like this is all you can see and you can't you don't know what's over here i don't blame you for freestyling you have to you can't see any anything back here so how are you supposed to plan the only you can plan for is should i go this way or should i go this way right and so sometimes there is no other thing like you have to freestyle and the other type of rotate that i'll mention is earlier okay so let's say this is the map like all the way out okay this is the map and obviously there's water on the edges and whatnot but let's say you land currently right here and zone falls down here there is some initial plan you should have a rough structure a loose structure of where you want to go so let's say um this is the you know the tempo the top right of the map yeah yeah and then this is like um eagle so let's say this is the case though the rough structure should quite literally be like hey i'm gonna go this way first i'm gonna go under misty i'm gonna or not misty but what's the place you're sleeping uh yeah i'm gonna go under sleepy sounds and i'm gonna go this way and then this way and then this is um coney this is a rough structure the reason i say have a rough structure and not a very very concrete structure is because plans change fortnite is very much a game where you cannot plan out from zone one to zone nine you can't you have to react to what's happening in front of you so let's say i i i do my plan and then google starts coming out do i still do i still do my plan no i don't i don't i need to stop here like maybe i let you go pass and then i go this way maybe through sleeping maybe because i see no one in sleepy so that's the thing collect information while you're rotating and change your plan accordingly and that's why igl is such a hard job is because you can't just sort of it's not chess you can't plan from the beginning um and be like oh this is what i'm gonna do because things change plans change some people are dumb and they don't do the thing that you expect them to do and sometimes there's new information that you have to account for maybe as you're passing by sleepy you see a perfect third up third-party opportunity because they're very like all inviting and and you see the opportunity okay and let's screw this rotate and let's do it right and then think about what happens after you get that fight hey now we have 400 surge and we're late for zone what does that mean for a rotate that probably means we should just go dead side and just go like this right so like that's the point it's very intuitive it's very in the moment because in the moment allows you to take in information and change your decisions if need be okay and i think that's the most important thing about fortnite is realize that you can't plan for everything so a lot of people do the thing where they um let's say they land temple uh and they have these surge routes okay if zone shows here zhongsuo is here zone shows here zone shows here and zone shows in the middle what are my plans for those five scenarios that's okay because as long as there's rough structures you should be fine okay as long as they're very uh loose planned okay because you should be able you should you should be allowed to change if needed uh and so that's the key thing in my personal opinion i don't think it's wrong to plan for this because a lot of teams do this um as long as you understand that they should not be concrete okay next question any questions about that one no no okay cool only trading equal damage can't find the opening to start winning you know what this means right this means you and your opponent are equally good at peaks and and aiming yeah okay so if you want to get into situations where you're winning more often uh you need to get better at fighting that's quite literally the only thing and when i say fighting if you want me to be more specific because fighting is a very broad term uh peaks and aim because sometimes you'll hit him for 20 but their head was exposed too and you could have hit him for 150. so you know like and and because i watch like pretty high level people like i watched donnie's like i literally live coaching him yesterday and and in general i watch people like this i know it's possible to hit 150 consistently and so that is an option right so practice like because it's very difficult for me to give advice for this one other than get better at fighting because fighting is very instinctual it's very mechanical right i can't be like um even though it's it kind of sucks in terms of advice like oh aim better it's just the truth like that is the only answer there's no other like strategy necessarily to actually do more damage you have to peek better you have to aim better and peaking and aiming usually is just a instinctual thing okay um in solos three med kits versus one men missed in my personal opinion i believe med mist is better because let's say you have three med kids the only application i could sort of see for medkits being better is if you take 90 white damage several times in a row and that in itself is like unlikely like that's so unlikely right so like if you maybe take some weight damage you can just use your magnets it's very efficient item because you only use up um let's say 30 30 uh charges from the amendments instead of you know 100 from the med kit so like it's just i just think that madness is better and it had better applications than end game so that's what i want to hold if you have the option okay okay the administ uh taken info as you go rotate and be freestyled and then the last one is ultimately need to get better at peaks you like do you genuinely practice box fights slash box fight realistics every single day no no i just play realistic that's not that bad okay so that's not that bad uh realistic tv twos um but here's the thing a lot of people can practice those sorts of things but essentially if you practice those sorts of things and then accept the fact that like you're taking a lot of damage and then just move on like maybe you're not trying hard enough to to take less damage in those sort of things maybe you're just playing right and people do that all the time they just play and i do that too like but i don't think it's right i think it's better to actually focus on trying to take less damage do more you'll because let's say you do autopilot you're probably playing the exact same way you do in game right and so you're not changing anything so nothing nothing's going to change you're just going to keep taking damage as you complained about before right and so the thing is if you actively think about you know trying to not take damage in those 2v2 realistics yes it takes more mental effort and yes it's draining but it's very important you'll you'll find yourself trying to take less damage in the fight itself in the practice and then you'll practice in the better way you're practicing to change your your habits so maybe you'll start realizing hey it's because when i do peak i overstep i'm maybe i'm overswinging too hard maybe that's a problem i don't know or maybe i'm peeking uh like way too often when i can see them looking at me maybe i should go for peaks more often when my teammates had their attention and so then i could shoot them in the back of their head right things like that that those those minor details is literally all the difference and but the only way you'll ever catch them or notice them is if you go into the practice with the mentality of trying to fix that issue right trying to fix the trading equal damage so yeah so i'm glad you recognized the issue of um you know doing 100 and taking 100 like it doesn't actually do much unless your teammate's very close to finish that 100 guy um but uh i'm glad you recognized the issue because a lot of people think like oh in a 2v2 if i do damage and take damage i definitely did something good like no nothing really happened because now you're out of the fight and so is the enemy but it's sort of not neutral nothing crazy you did nothing crazy that's how i see about it but yeah i'm i'm glad you you recognized the issue so do you guys have any questions overall before we move on [Music]

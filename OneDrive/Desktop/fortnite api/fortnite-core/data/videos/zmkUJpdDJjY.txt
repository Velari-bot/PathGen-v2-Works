in this video I'm going to teach you how to correctly pressure an opponent's box in fortnite I'm going to start out by showing you a couple scenarios in creative and then giving you some in-game examples at the end time stamps down below let's hop into it let's pretend that this bot is an opponent and he is boxed up in Brick okay what are the ways that he can attack me he can either double edit up at me and take a pump shot or he can jump out either of these sides and go for a side jump so when I start to pressure this opponent what I do is I build cones around and then I smack on this cone and I get ready to build a wall I always build a wall after getting the cone and then I go off to the side I start smacking but I'm waiting because he could edit up at me any second if he does that I reset my wall edit a window Peak shot but let's say the opponent has two boxes built now so let's say he's sitting in these boxes here and I'm going to pressure one he can edit from either of these sides let's say I don't even know which side he is in I need to make sure I'm safe when starting the pressure here so first I'm going to build a double edit here build walls around you could even build walls behind you if you're afraid of getting shot by a third party but then let's say I want to smack on this wall I can edit like this if he edits on me I just reset but let's say I want to edit here I can go for this I just have to be aware he could mantle up the back and go for a pump this is how I approach a box I always block off all the angles of danger before I start to pressure let's say the opponent is boxed right here and I want a pressure from just outside as well instead of from above what do I do here I build this wall because he could edit this and take a peek on me at any moment so I Build That Wall I build right here so we can't ramp over me I build a wall to my side in case he hits that wall and goes for a shot and a cone in that box why do I do all this to protect myself I know he can still edit from the top if I see him flip this cone up that probably means he's going up and I can build a wall there edit the wall and take a shot so I just start smacking this wall pulling out my shotgun eventually I get the wall edit a peak good shot boom how do I even start to pressure this well first of all this is typically the kind of fight you don't want to take just because this player is playing so passive to the point where it can grief you let's say I want to focus on this build right here then I'll do all of this see if he double heads up here I can just go behind this wall take a peak shot if you double edits up those back walls I have these walls as protection I gotta be ready because he could mantle up the back here and surprise me from above but realistically when you're fighting a player like this they're just gonna keep on re-boxing on the same layer so I start pressure in here and basically at this point I know by taking these tops it's not going to do too much but let's say when I get that top he resets these walls I can jump down and go for a quick wall take if I don't get it I jump back up start to get doubles from a ton of different angles protecting yourself while you get the attack going and once you get enough doubles like once I get this here he's typically not going to go back to this box because I have doubles there if he does I can get a quick shot on him a lot of times they're gonna go out the side and that's why you have this double here if they go out that side boom you have a shot and you can drop down here get another shot a lot of times they'll edit here they'll see you have the doubles so they'll go back in this box and try to go out a different side and then boom you just immediately race them to that side once you get like two doubles on them that's your chance to go for pre-boxes you just have to start slowly attacking and make sure you're building these walls to block your angles while you attack and once you get the walls you set up a good Peak now we're going to be going over a couple fights from recent tournaments tournament Players Play Boxes all the time so it's so important to learn how to attack I get a Health Advantage on this player to start which puts him into the defensive mode and he starts to play boxes I immediately get off to the left side of his box notice how there's a ramp against his wall in this type of situation a lot of players will just jump in using that ramp I make him think I'm going to jump in his box but I'm really watching him to see which direction he's going I see him place the ramp so I know he's going upwards and I try to get a wall and ramp on him but it was a little bit laggy so I didn't get it he boxes up again and I put a ramp in his box when I break the wall I immediately look to box the player in two separate directions so I have a higher chance of getting him if I would have stayed above the Box this would have been a perfect play we end up restarting the fight he's down by the Vault here and I pressure very carefully I use this wall in front of me as a right hand Peak he only has one way he can attack me and it's by jumping up that little staircase so if he goes for counter damage I have a free kill sure enough that's exactly what he does I just keep pretending like I'm pressuring and then pulling out my shotgun and I get a free kill the next clip I have a Health Advantage here and I noticed there's a third party sprang from the East so this player underneath me is feeling a lot of pressure but I gotta make sure I'm blocking my angles while pushing up super simple example I just built a wall to block off that third party while I pressured from above and got the kill this next fight is an interesting example something I haven't talked about in the video at all it starts out at get a Health Advantage so I'm looking to keep the pressure on I run directly up against this opponent's wall the reason is he has his ramp flipped up so if he was going to take an edit on me he would have to reset the cone and edit the wall so as soon as I see him reset the cone I'm gonna pull my shotgun out one other thing to note if you're pressuring directly against someone's wall is if their wall is weak if they edit that wall it's gonna be one shot if the wall was fully built and they edit the wall it's not one shot knowing that information I knew if he made an edit on me I could just shoot the wall once get it back so I'm not at danger being up against this wall here after dealing some damage I immediately drag cones into the box he was headed that way I have some piece control on him he ends up repositioning up layers I immediately follow him get on his wall and I do that trick from earlier where I have a ramp behind me and it looks like I'm gonna jump in his box I did that and immediately repositioned to a different angle in hopes that he would Rebox from feeling scared that I was gonna jump in then notice here I did that trick where he reset his metal wall when it wasn't fully built so it was one shot both of his walls here were one shot so I was just able to keep the pressure on heavy and I got the kill in this next clip I'm finally applying some of that stuff that we talked about at the start of the video where I'm blocking off angles of danger it starts out where I get a Health Advantage here once I got that Health Advantage I know I need to get the pressure on get on his wall So eventually I find him here and I'm just holding my pump out in case he edits a lot of lower level players will set up a bad Peak immediately but I stand far enough back where I could build a floor to block his shot if he set up a good Peak I'm always prepared for any play they can make he wasn't making a play so I set up the protective push that I was talking about earlier right get off to the left build a wall so we can't edit on me from the left and a wall on my right so he can't piece me I use that safe push to start the pressure and then he ends up repositioning resetting a wall I knew that wall was one shot so I just got in the biggest thing you should be learning from these fights is how to have a plan for any move they can make whether it be shooting a weak wall if they make an edit or having angles blocked so they can't set up rayhand Peaks never give them an opportunity to make a play on you this was the fight as I got third partied from the previous one and this player just never had a chance I'm playing around this tops but never giving him a chance to actually shoot me these last three fights are from the duo cash cup with Trey which is coming to the main Channel soon I started out by pinching the duo between me and my Duo I'm pressuring the further guy and I'm blocking all my angles to start building walls around me where he could possibly go for edits stuff like that but the guy's Duo builds up over top of me so I have to build up and we just start spraying at him from two directions and it leads to a free kill we do the same thing to the second player just get on opposite sides and finish the fight the next fight this team has four boxes is built I'm pushing up slowly trying to figure out exactly where they are this is a perfect example of why you need to build walls when you're pressuring an opponent's floor a lot of times they go for that instant edit up and if I didn't Build That Wall I would have got double pumped or a piece controlled and full boxed I used the wall that I built as a right hand Peak and try to get some damage dealt but he just barely blocked it as soon as they reset that metal floor what have we learned it's one shot so I'm able to break it and get the wall in between me and the enemy Trey was pressuring from the other side so I dropped down and went for an attack but they countered it pretty nicely so I had to jump on out of there and then once Trey got more pressure applied that's when I jump back in and start attacking from the back another good example of pinching the enemies and attacking a 4x4 that's all I got for this video attacking boxes is such a complicated topic so I hope this helps a little bit I might do a part two when I get more in-game examples if that's something you guys want to see let me know down below new creative map coming out later this week so stay tuned I'll catch in the next one peace

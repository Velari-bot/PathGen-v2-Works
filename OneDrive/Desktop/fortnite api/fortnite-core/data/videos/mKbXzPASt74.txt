today's video now just a quick word on the mans nois Discord server which is about to hit 2,000 members if you guys are looking for a place to not only become part of the community but also looking for a place to build friends and also find other people interested in improving then the mosis Discord is for you the link to which is in the description down below I would really appreciate it if you could join okay so I'm going to take you guys step by step through every tip about what you should do in your off spor section of the game so starting off at the very beginning and your first tip that's all going to be about your drop strategy and what is the most optimal thing to do first of all you want to make sure that you're perfecting your Glide and this is dropping from the battle bus with precision in order to land first because obviously if you land first it's really really important now I'm sure that most of you guys watching this video actually know what a drop map is but effectively what it does is it allows you to aim for the closest low elevation area near your POI now there are many different websites you can use to get a drop map such as Landing tutorial.com or you guys can buy some but effectively if you're landing at a drop spot like a gas station and there's a river nearby that's just at the base of a mountain if you Glide over that River at the base of the mountain instead of the mountain it's going to make you pull your glider lower which therefore means you're likely to land land first now of course this is a massive over like advantage over your opponent because if you land first you get the pick of the loot etc etc now if you do get a far drop away from the bus you want to make sure that you also spam your glider quite early so use space or X to spam your glider and then when you get near the POI dive straight down in order to make sure you land first again now just once you've pulled your glider here you can look around to spot opponents in midair because this allows you to identify where other players are landing and therefore you can adjust your plan for example there might be two different guns there might be a hollow twist AR and there might be just the generic pump shotgun now you might think okay land on the shotgun but actually in a quick offs spawn fight the hollow twist AR is probably better as you can beam the player before they land especially if you are the first one to land so that whole tip is about just making sure that you are landing correctly and being the first player to land to give yourself that initial Advantage so tip number two is all going to be about early engagement preparation because once you've landed you need to make sure that you can win that offs spawn fight so the first little part of this is about looting efficiently and originally you want to make sure that you prioritize weapons over consumables specifically if you are contested because if you're contested you're not really going to be able to eliminate anyone with a mini Shield you need a blim weapon now immediately you can look for initial combat if you have like a shotgun or an SMG if you get these off spawn you can look to try and push the enemy very very quickly and I want to talk about something which is massively important for this idea of pushing off of Spawn straight away and that's going to be the 10c rule now I think you give yourself around 10 seconds to push the player off of Spawn say you get an initial shotgun or SMG advantage and you can go to push them and if if you do eliminate them in that time that's great but if you don't and they manage to get in the house then I'd leave and that's because in these 10 seconds then they could pop two big pots or they could find Minis and a shotgun and they could end up being more stacked than you so if you can't get them in 10 seconds i' dip away now you want to make sure that you gather at least 150 materials and you can do this quickly from Fast farming mats like trees or rocks there are different re rocks and trees sorry that farm more quickly than others so make sure you know where these are around your drop spots and then also you can use environmental knowledge to your advantage so looking for structures which give you quick High ground or Shield yourself during fights is key because off spawn not that many people have mats so if you're already on height you have an advantage of being able to spray down below now I also think of Spawn that it's important that you plan an Escape Route just in case thing goes south so look forward for look around sorry for cars or Mobility around your drop spots or pads that you could use to escape depending on whether you're actually winning that off spawn fight or not okay so now moving on to my third tip I'm going to talk about combat execution and how you guys can actually win that fight off of Spawn and give yourself the upper hand so starting off just a few tips to give yourself the upper hand you want to secure High ground for a better angle onto the fight and also control because we know that the player on height often controls the fight and like I said in my last point it gives you the opportunity to spray it down onto the opponent and control the fight like that now also third partying another fight off of Spawn gives the opportunity for easy eliminations as players are most likely to be weak so always look to come in as that third party engagement if it's possible off the spawn next you want to also look to maintain pressure so aggressively pushing an enemy if they core of guard or lower materials can again lead to easy eliminations but when you do choose to aggressively push make sure that that you are decisive as hesitation gives your opponent time to heal or reposition and put themselves in a more advantageous situation now you want to make sure that you're also utilizing your bills effectively so make sure you're protecting yourself while looting or repositioning so you don't want the opponent to know where you are at all times off the spawn because it makes them easier to counter you and look to kill you also when you're taking the fight you want to make sure that you edit smarter and not faster and this is because you don't have that many mats so you want to try and set traps or bait your opponent into predictable actions in order to you just pick up that easy elimination off the SP born tip number four is going to be about what you should do post fight or post winning the fight because you need to have a routine so starting off you want to make sure that you heal and reset so after a fight prioritize healing immediately to avoid third party eliminations because like I said in the season there's loads of third parties in this meta with the Oni mask and blade so make sure that you heal as quick as possible and create boxes to slow down the fight if you are third partied but you also want to make sure that you rebuild your material count by farming quickly so look to go back to the fast farming mats around your location before rotating out and then after you've done this you then want to reass the area and check if other players remain in the POI if they don't you can prepare to loot the rest of the POI or make your rotation out to a better dead side of zone so that pretty much covers all the tips I have for actually winning off spawn but now tip number five is going to be about what to do if you're constantly losing off of Spawn because it's important that you adapt your mistakes so I'd recommend analyzing your loss s of Spawn so review replays to identify your errors this could be for example like stuff to look for like poor positioning maybe you had a bad drop you landed second compared to the opponent or you made the wrong weapon Choice off of Spawn you didn't get adequate match just stuff like that you need to look out for and identify which mistake you're making most common then you can take these mistakes and adjust your game plan because this then allows you to play in a certain way so you know how to win off spawn on a more regular basis now if you are just struggle losing off of Spawn anyway you can look to avoid overly contested areas if you are consistently losing fights so maybe look to land a less contested area such as somewhere on the outskirts of the map that isn't a big POI I'd also recommend practicing engagements in Creative or scrims in order to refine your mechanics off of Spawn an example could be like realistic 1 V ones but with off of Spawn loot because this gives you good practice but now it's time for me to give you guys an ingame example as to how you should exactly play off a spawn if you want to make sure you win on a more regular basis okay so originally I did actually talk over the Gameplay at the same time as I was playing however actually corrupted so I'm just going to voice over so as you guys can see as I get the best drop I dive over the river I'm Scouting Around and immediately I can see that one opponent behind me up in the glider there so my thinking right now is okay if he's contesting me I need to make sure that I get the guns off spawn so you'll notice that I run straight over to the SMG now he does decide to cut it short and go to that Bungalow so I Look to laser but I don't end up getting any opening damage on him there but now I know exactly where that player is I can plan out what I'm going to do so I jump down to these slurp Barrel right here to give myself some early shield and once I've completed my loot of both the buildings I then look to go straight down to where the fast farming mats are now there's the series of rocks and trees down here which I then Farm up as you guys can see which allows me to get to around about 300 wood or nearer to 500 wood by the time I get into a fight and CA Stone meaning I have 1,000 mats to get into into a fight like I do in this mid game fight against a player right here and obviously with the mat advantage and the Health Advantage if you guys look in my inventory I got six minis three medkits and a big and so many mats we should be able to comfortably clean up this mid game fight and we do a nice little Peak to catch that player right there and that allows us to get all the loot we need now if you look at my loot right there we've picked up a mid game fight against someone and we've won off of Spawn and now we're stacked to go into the rest of the game so that is exactly how you want to play if you want to win off spawn on a more regular basis now feel free to click this video on screen if you want to get good at fortnite this season thank you guys very much for watching peace out from me

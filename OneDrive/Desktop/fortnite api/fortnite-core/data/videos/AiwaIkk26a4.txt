So, you just started playing Fortnite and you're probably wondering how the heck people are building castles in 2 seconds or flickshotting you before you can even pull out your own shotgun. I've been there and you're probably there right now. It's super easy to feel like you'll never get as good as those sweaty pros you see on TikTok. But trust me, everyone starts somewhere. The key is to focus on the right things first and not get overwhelmed trying to do everything at once. You don't need to crank insane 90s or edit like a maniac right away. You got to lock in the basics first. That's where all the improvement starts. The first thing you should really work on is your core mechanics. Don't worry about being flashy, triple edits, or high ground retakes just yet. Instead, your main focus should be your aim. Aim is literally everything in Fortnite, especially now that shotgun fights are way more common in close range. Practice your flick shots with shotguns, your tracking with ARs, and your precision with long-range snipers, even though they're not in every single season. If you're on PC, you can use aim trainers like Kovac or Aim Labs, but even if you're on console, creative maps like Raiders aim trainer are super helpful and actually fun to grind. Another thing that helped me improve a lot was learning crosshair placement. Like no joke, this one simple thing makes such a huge difference in the game. Always keep your crosshair at head level and aim where you think an enemy is going to peak from. It saves you time and you'll start hitting shots way faster and more consistently. You'll stop getting caught off guard so much and your fights will feel a lot smoother. Movement is another thing players don't think about, but it actually changes everything. You can't just stand still and shoot. That's how you get beamed. You need to learn how to strafe, crouch, spam, jump peak, and slide to mess with your opponent's aim. A moving target is 100 times harder to hit than someone just standing there like a bot. Now, when it comes to building, you want to start simple. You don't have to know every retake in the book. Just get comfortable with basic 1x one box fights, placing walls and ramps correctly, and using cones and fights. These are the building blocks, literally, of every advanced play later on. You can't get better at building if your basic walls and ramps are all scuffed. Keep it clean, and don't rush to advanced stuff until you're confident with every basic core mechanic. Editing is another thing people try to speedrun, but it's way more important to be consistent than fast. You want to start with basic window edits, top corner edits, and get really good at edit, shoot, reset drills. If you can do those clean every time, you're already ahead of most casual players. Trust me, you don't need to look like a creative warrior. Just being reliable in fights is enough to win. Once you've got some of the mechanics down, you need to start building good fighting habits. A lot of people lose fights not because they can't shoot, but because they take dumb fights or dumb mistakes. You got to know when to push and when to back off. Just because you see someone doesn't mean you have to key them. Ask yourself if you got more health, better loot, or a good position. If not, it might be smarter to rotate out or third party instead of going full send into a bad fight. Also, always use cover, whether it's a tree, a rock, a wall, or even your own builds. Never stand out in the open during fights. That's like asking to get destroyed. Play around angles, and peak smartly. It's one of the easiest ways to stay alive longer and win way more fights. And don't forget how important box fighting is. It's still huge in build mode. And knowing how to claim walls, place cones in enemy boxes, and make quick edits can make you feel like a beast. Try maps like Raiders 1v ones or clicks box fight maps to practice these. During fights, it's also super important to heal when you can. Like, yeah, it's tempting to keep pushing, but if you're low HP, you're just making it easier for the other player to kill you. Build a few layers up, pop some minis or a medkit, and get ready to counter push. Sometimes people chase too hard, and that's your chance to turn the fight around with a sneaky little edit play, pump shot, and get the damage in your favor. One thing that a lot of beginners skip is learning how to rotate properly and have good map awareness. Knowing how to rotate efficiently can actually win games, even if your aim isn't perfect. So, you want to pay attention to where zones usually pull. They're kind of predictable now. Learn the best ways to rotate after you land and try going to dead side of the zone where fewer players are. You want to use any type of movement or vehicles to get there, so use them to move quickly, but don't just drive straight into fights. And always watch the kill feed. If a bunch of people are dying near you, that area is probably chaotic. Rotate the other way and live longer. Another way to get better faster is by playing all the different types of modes in the game. Each one helps you improve in different ways. Zero build is amazing for working on your aim, movement, and positioning since you can't rely on building to save you. Build mode. Pubs are more chill and give you space to try new strats without sweaty players everywhere. Ranked is where you really level up because everyone plays smarter and harder. Creative is the best for warming up and grinding mechanics. You should split your play sessions with a mix of these, like warm up and creative for 15 to 30 minutes. Hop into a few pub games to test what you've been working on and then play ranked when you're feeling locked in. Speaking of warm-up, having a consistent routine is honestly overpowered, and every pro player does it. So, why shouldn't you if you're just beginning? You don't need to play 8 hours a day, but doing the same warm-up routine daily will help you improve way faster than just randomly jumping into games. Once again, you will need to change your routine as you get better. But starting with a simple routine, and then going to more advanced ones as you level up is very important. Something simple like 5 minutes on an aim trainer, 10 minutes of edits and movement drills, and 10 minutes of box fights or build fights, and then 5 minutes of freebuilding is perfect. After that, jump into three pub matches to chill, then five rank games for a challenge, and maybe a couple creative 1v ones to end your session. Also, a cool down. You'll notice progress way faster this way. Another tip, another tip that helped me a ton was watching pro players, but not copying everything they do. Like, yeah, clicks, mirror, and reit, they were all insane when I was watching, but trying to play exactly like them when you're still learning is going to make you play worse. Instead, focus on why they do what they do. Pay attention to how they rotate, how they take fights, how they built to protect themselves, and watch how they clutch under pressure. You want to watch analysis videos from people like Ozantics or Resub 2. They break everything down so it actually makes sense. Or Manzanos, who now breaks down tournaments so you guys can actually know what to do in those sense. And don't forget to fix your settings and HUD, too. If you're on controller, use linear input. It just feels smoother and helps with consistency. Use your builder pro and make sure you have a confirm edit on release so it turned on so you have faster editing. For sensitivity, don't mess with it every other day. Start with a middle- range sense like 800 DPI with 8 or 6% XY on controller and make tiny changes only if needed. Your HUD should be clean and not cluttered. You only really need to get see storm timers, health, and your inventory. Everything else just blocks your view and gets in the way. Now, let's talk about mindset. One of the most important things when it comes down to playing Fortnite. Honestly, this is one of the most underrated parts that you guys actually need. If you don't have the right mindset, you'll never actually improve at the game. Don't rage quit every time you lose. Instead, think about what went wrong and what you could have done differently. Everyone loses, even pros. The important thing is learning from each loss and using it to get better. Celebrate your small wins, too. Did you survive a spawn? Did you get a good piece of control today? That's progress, and recognize it. And don't compare yourself to others. Everyone's on their own journey, so focus on yours. Also, play with friends who actually want to improve and are chill about losing. If they're toxic, just mute them and find a new community. Negative vibes slow you down more than you think. And if you really want to level up, use tools to track your progress. Check Fortnite tracker to see your KD, win percentage, and placements. Review your replays to see what mistakes you keep making. You can even join Discord servers and host scrims or practice games to fight better players and learn from them. And once again, I'm going to plug my Discord. We have a bunch of resources in there. We have a VOD reviewing resource that will teach you how to actually VAD review so you can be more efficient. We also have drop maps and we're working on a lot more resources for you guys so you guys can actually get better at the game. And my channel is a perfect place to figure out how to get better at every aspect of the game. The last thing I'll say is to set goals and grind towards them. It doesn't have to be anything crazy. Your goal could be something like getting your first win in ranked, hitting champion rank, winning a 1 v one against your friend that's a little bit better than you, or even improving your aim accuracy by just 3%. Write it down and keep track of your progress. Fortnite isn't just a game. It's something you can actually get better at every single day if you stick with it and stick with routine and watch more of my videos to help you get better faster. So yeah, if you're new to Fortnite, don't stress it. Lock in the basics, fight smarter, rotate better, and most importantly, enjoy the process. If you're not enjoying the process of getting better at Fortnite, then I don't know why you're doing it. Playing games are to have fun and improve at something you actually have passion for. You're going to get better. Just give it time and keep grinding.

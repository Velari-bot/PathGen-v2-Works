are you guys tired of using the same old prex over and over and you just want to learn something new and effective you have come to the right video in today's video guys I will show you one of the best highy ground retakes for beginner all right guys so the very first retake I want to show you is called the crossover there's actually two versions which I'm going to be showing you both right now so let's start off with in my opinion the easier one so basically looks like this so how to actually do this is pretty self-explanatory you just B basically go put a ramp Place Another ramp right here also and doesn't matter which side you really go for I usually go for the right one then what you need to do is just place a floor and land on a stair then just basically do the same thing over and over and you can just go to the side like this also if you actually like want to move and this is the first version guys it's really really easy just like what takes you like what 50 mats so the next version is even like you you don't even have to waste that much material it's like three mats something like that basically go up you place a floor a stair and you just jump place a wow and a stair and it basically looks like this in full speed so one thing that I will advise you when doing this retake this one like this version is try to jump from the very top just so you land on stair but if you jump really far down it's going to get your head stuck beneath the stair so if you combine them both you will look something like this and as you guys can see that's a pretty pretty good retake if you were to ask me you can just go to the side and yeah this is a pretty pretty cool retake guys all right good second retake is also pretty simple so basically this is what it looks like you starting off with a cone you edit this particular Tire right here and you place walls around it then you just like want to edit this wall you want to place a cone and when you jump just edit the cone like this okay and what you need to do is place a floor edit the floor place a ramp and just place um a wall right here you just want to flip this cone into uh this side and you can just continue with your retakes just like this okay so this is basically what it looks like in full speed and when you're here you can just go up or you can just go to the side just like I did the first time all right guys third Pi I want to show you might be hard for some of Y but I promise you if you just keep on doing this over time it'll get easier for you so basically this is what you need to do what you need to do our advise you really start off with a ramp behind you and just put a a comb and a floor but instead of editing it just like this to go up what you need to do you just edit these two uh these Styles right here and you just want to slide your character to this side so it looks something like this and when you're here I would advise you have a ramp right here in case your opponent could be C be on high he can just like spray you down and if your opening is right here you could just cone him just like this and you can just fall box in and clip them and this is basically what it looks like in full speed okay so this is basically what it looks like in full speed and you can just do a three RIT on your oppent and just clip okay guys so the fourth retake is the hardest rake out of every single retake I'm going to show you in this video so if you're a beginner I would definitely advise you try to actually Master this retake when you're a little bit more experienced in the game cuz it's a lot of practice to be honest if you're a beginner so without wasting your time let me show what the retake looks like so you're going to start off with a triple just like so and you want to place hold if I kind of messed up the retake want to start off with a triple it okay and you want to place a cone and a floor right here but after the last retake you need to edit these Styles and what you need to do is you got to be halfway up the stair you want to place a wall and just jump and try to land on a stair then what you need to do is place a floor in a COR again make sure you do a triple because you will need the wall and when you're here you just turn backwards and place off um I mean a stair and a cone and edit the cone just like this and what you need to do is just do a oneid tel if you don't know what a one side Tel is it basically looks like this uh you'll place a stair right here and just walls around it and you want to just edit this wall and you could pretty much box the uh cone so many times if you're opening is on high he going to try onun the cone and you can just box him and you can just clip him and this is a pretty pretty cool retake let me show what it looks like in full speed also all right guys this is basically what the r looks like I just placed um stair instead of cone so yeah this is basically what the retake looks like all right guys so the fifth retake is also pretty hard let me show you what it looks like so basically you want to start off with a cone and a floor and what you need to do is just edit this tile and place a wall just like this and what you to do is just jump and you try to land on the floor and put a stair behind you and what you to do just edit this wall turn backwards and just basically do the same move like I showed you a couple minutes ago and go to the side just like I I all right guys this is basically the retake and you can just box your opponent just like I did and it's a super cool retake and I'll definitely advise you take your time on this because it looks pretty all right guys the last and final retake I want to show you is basically the easiest out of every single retake I showed you I just wanted to put it at the end so you must have a stair behind you and you can just tack up as high as you guys want and let's say this is pretty good right now what you need to do is just place a cone on this um stair right here and what you need to do is Place Another cone edit this cone jump attach a floor and a stair what you need to do edit the floor and place two walls like this jump and basically do the same thing again as you guys see this is basically what the rch looks like super simple and it's definitely going to take you around a couple minutes to actually Master this because you don't have to edit that much and it's just super self-explanatory guys all right boys really hope you guys enjoyed this retakes and let me know down in the comments if you guys actually mastered at least two of them cuz I'll just be happy to help you guys it's been your boy chopperman and as always see you guys next time and peace out y'all

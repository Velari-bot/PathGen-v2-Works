comments so you can get started today thank you buff once again for sponsoring today's video so hopping into this video guys we're gonna be splitting this video into two sections which are building and editing and then aiming since building and editing typically go hand in hand i decided to combine those into one section so starting off this video we are gonna go ahead and start with building and editing now the biggest thing that i've noticed that tends to improve your building and editing is definitely gonna be realistic scenarios by realistic scenarios what i mean is basically anything that allows you to practice things that actually work in real fights so in this section i'm mainly going to be going over more realistic practice methods that help you to improve fast rather than things like edit courses that don't necessarily have realistic situations in them getting into our first practice method for building and editing and that's going to be peace control maps now peace control maps are a bit different from regular drill type maps because they actually involve situations that you're going to be running into in game and they help you master moves you can actually use against real opponents on a consistent basis when it comes to which exact maps to use for this i have two that i typically recommend the first one is raiders peace control map which has over 25 different scenarios that you can use to practice all sorts of peace control drills i'll throw the code up to that map on screen right now if you want to try that out the other map that i recommend for peace control is more of a core style map with all sorts of different editing and peace control drills and this one is a fantastic supplement to raiders map as well the map is called tito and it says realistic editing and peace control map and one thing i really like about this map is the difficulty since there's an easy and advanced editing section as well as an easy and advanced peace control section so with that said i'm gonna go ahead and toss the code up to that one on screen right now as well but moving on from that my next method to improve your building and editing dramatically in chapter three season two is gonna be 1v1s now obviously 1v1s do involve your aim as well but the thing is you're typically going to spend the massive bulk of your fight trying to outplay your opponent through builds and edits and you're only going to spend a few seconds actually trying to shoot your opponent so ultimately 1v1s are a really good way to train your mechanics in a highly realistic environment since you're against another real player there are two sorts of 1v1s you can use for this including build fights and realistics the reason i recommend build fights is because the unlimited materials basically allow you to build and edit an absolute ton and get a ton of mechanical work in but at the same time you're forced to use more strategy and kind of think through your builds and edits and realistic since your materials are limited so overall i would recommend a fair mix of both forms of 1v1s if you're trying to step up your building and editing and if you guys need some maps to use for these 1v1s i'll go ahead and put up a code on screen to a build fight map and a realistic map that i really like in case you don't already have them the build fight map code is on the top and the realistic 1v1 map code is on the bottom moving on from that though and onto our next and actually our final building and editing strategy and that's going to be learning from pros now you may be thinking your mechanics are all physical right like you're literally just clicking keys or moving joysticks so how would you get better at doing that from watching a pro play but the thing is if you actually watch pros and you learn from the techniques and strategies they use in fights you can also learn mechanical moves to apply to your own gameplay obviously if a pro player is using a technique then it's probably reasonably effective and by doing that you technically don't get better at pressing the keys or moving your joysticks but it does help you learn new moves which can in turn improve your mechanics in the long run so in conclusion take the time to watch some pro gameplay and take note of what techniques they use and that should be a big help when it comes to getting better mechanics specifically when it comes to obviously editing and building with that said guys that's going to wrap it up for my top recommended methods to improve your building and editing within the current season so for the next section we're going to be moving on to aiming and we'll be discussing some of my favorite methods when it comes to that the thing about aiming in fortnite is that it's actually really simple to learn and most people try to overcomplicate it in my opinion there are two major practice methods that will help you get insane in fortnite chapter 3 season two so i'll be going over those in this section first method i'm gonna recommend in this section is gonna be target practice what target practice basically means is any sort of practice that utilizes targets that move around and helps you build muscle memory and mouse control when it comes to aiming now there are two different kind of like subcategories you can go for when trying to use target practice in a fortnight aim training routine the first option is external aim trainers then the second option is in game aim trainers for the first option external lane trainers there are two options that come to mind the first is kovacs fps aim trainer which is a classic aim trainer that has a ton of different scenarios to choose from and the second one is aim beast which also has a ton of built-in scenarios a built-in ranking system as well as built-in routines you can follow specifically for fortnite those options are only available for pc and you can find either of those apps through the steam store if you want to try them out the next option for target practice though and the one i expect most people will probably use since most of you are either not on pc or not able to spend the money currently is going to be in-game aim trainers the most popular in-game target aim trainer by far is definitely going to be skavic's aim trainer in the same trainer you have a ton of different scenarios ranging from tracking to click timing to flicks and overall it's a really good way to practice your aim in fortnight if you do want to give that a shot i'll toss the code up for skavik's aim trainer right now if you don't play on pc or you don't want to dish out the money for a specific game trainer outside of fortnite then this is definitely a fantastic option for target practice and will give you pretty similar results moving on to our next method of aim training though and this one is going to be aim duels aim duels and fortnite pretty much refer to an aim map where you and one other opponent are placed together and your goal is to basically shoot your opponent non-stop to practice your aim these can be all sorts of things like shooting an opponent who's gliding in the air being thrown into a box and having a flick towards your opponent or even something where you're in a box together and you're kind of just spraying one another to work on your smg aim overall aim duels are a really good way to get realistic practice since you're against a real player with real movement and my top recommendation for an aimdual map is definitely going to be raiders 1v1 aim trainer in this map the process is super simple you and your opponent load in you can either log in with a friend or hop into the portal to find a random opponent you select the same hp you shoot a scenario to select it you grab the same weapon and you're in and as i said before these scenarios range dramatically a few years ago when aim duels came out for the first time they were all pretty much just you and one opponent trapped in a box together spamming smgs of shotguns but over time they've evolved to not only be that but also glider scenarios movement scenarios and all sorts of other things that really make angels an incredible form of practice so i would strongly recommend that if you're trying to improve your aim that you give aim duels a shot if you're interested i'll toss up the code to raider's aim dual map on screen right now with all that said guys that's going to wrap it up for today's video on how to improve your mechanics fast in chapter 3 season 2. overall by utilizing the methods i've gone over in this video you should be well on your way to getting far better mechanics in all categories of your gameplay ultimately by using the correct practice methods as well as doing them on a consistent basis you should see some dramatic improvement relatively fast if you guys enjoyed this video then be sure to drop a like on it and consider subscribing as well if you want to see more

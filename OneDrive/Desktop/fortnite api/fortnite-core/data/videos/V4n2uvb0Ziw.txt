I personally struggled with transferring my creative skill into real matches against Real players especially in ranked and tournaments however this is much improved now and I think I've learned how to do it so let's transfer your fortnite skill into game and get you the results you want join my Discord Link in description and let's go I think it's obvious that you are doing something different in real games than you're doing in Creative you can't possibly be playing the same because if you were playing the same you'd be getting the same result so something is making you play differently You' got think about what that is identify it and only then you can think to change it whether that be in ranked you're scared you're scared of losing percent if you're scared of he losing percent you might play a little bit more safe play a bit more scared and that might be what losing you to fights you might be choking your edit you might be choking a couple shots all things that you wouldn't be choking in Creative because you're just less nervous the reason why you want to identify this issue is so you can change it if you know what the issue is you're much more likely to change it and make it better and just identifying it just puts you at East a little bit more so let's go on about changing it for starters if you feel like your creative skill is far higher than your in game skill I want you to quit creative unless you're warming up after you've warmed up I don't want you to go back in Creative just play the matches you feel worse then if that's in-game play in-game matches all day especially if your problem is nerves playing normal matches the entire day will really help you it's going to keep putting you in those nervous situations and if you keep getting put in the same situations you're going to become less nervous after quite a while it's going to take time but it will happen guys and it has happened to me I played solo ranked for about 3 weeks straight and now when I'm in fights I feel a lot more calm a lot more collected and therefore my plays reflect that remember guys if you find these useful so far put in code jkc in the fortnite item shop as that's the number one way to support me if we reach 75 supporters on The Code by the end of the month I'm going to release my new Zone Wars map to the public and I know you guys have been wanting that you don't actually have to buy anything with the code just having it in supports me greatly thank you let's get back to the video a little trick I like to use for when I'm in game and I'm feeling a little bit nervous especially in tournaments or ranks your choice I'm going to sit there before a fight and I'm going to imagine I'm in Ken beans realistics if you know what Ken beans realistics is it's a map that Ken's made and it's basically plays out realistic situations but in Creative so you can get a lot of practice at once it's super useful to pretend like you're in one of those when you're in a match because you're generally nervous in one of Ken's realistic Maps so if you play like you would in n in game you're generally going to win a lot more fights because you're not going to be choking edits like you would if you're nervous by believing you're in Creative you're also going to go for the plays that you wouldn't go for in game when you're low HP and you need to go for a counter shot you would go for that in Creative 100% of the time because you know that if you hit the counter shot you're going to win the fight but in game you would not go for it some of you because you're a little bit nervous you're a little bit scared and you're holding back so you're not going to go for it you're just going to keep keep on boxing away and eventually you're going to die but if you believe your in keni is realistics you're going to go for that shot and it's going to work out in your favor however would you go about this mindset is just before the fight take a deep breath you're in Creative now good luck as I said guys a lot of the reason your creative skill isn't transferring is because of the nerves you face in game cuz that's the only possible difference if you want a larger and more in-depth tutorial make sure you comment down below and join my Discord server to give me more fortnite tutorial ideas that's all for me guys watch this video on the screen because it is a banger and it's going to show you how to stop dying to WK I'll see you in the next one guys thank you

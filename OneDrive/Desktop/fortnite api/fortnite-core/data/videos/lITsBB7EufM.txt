you want to go pro in fortnite chapter 4 this is the advice the unfiltered advice that you absolutely need in order to achieve that watch this video to the end and be patient with me because this is a very important message that I must put out to everyone who has a goal or an aspiration to become a pro in fortnite chapter 4. oftentimes this can be seen as a fresh start because we have a new map because there's a new meta because there's new guns and you're absolutely right we do have new things to learn and this is an opportunity because all the pros and all the tier 2s and tier threes and everyone else who is competing has to deal with this Fresh Start too which puts you on equal footing to actually win the race to becoming amazing at this game now let's test if you were paying attention there's something absolutely wrong with what I just said which will lead into the first topic of this video what I just said is that there's a fresh start right because there's a new map new guns you know you're on equal footing with the pros it's absolutely not true there are certain skills that carry over from chapter to chapter regardless of the map that you must learn and get good at and be scary skills are the reason why you see the same Pros placing at the top over and over these carryover skills are what I like to call the fundamentals of the game guns are not a fundamental of the game map isn't really a fundamental of the game you can get used to this very very quickly right what are the fundamentals of the game this will be the first topic of today's video later on I also want to address how to practice properly and also how to develop a really good intuition which is something that carries a lot of the pros because oftentimes when you ask the pros to explain a concept or try to explain what they're doing they're unable to and the reason is is because their intuition is what carries them not anything else so let's talk about it now why should we know the fundamentals of the game what good does it do us right if we have a limited amount of time per day to practice it's very important we prioritize and so what should we prioritize there are certain skills that give you a bigger Roi than other skills right and so for that reason it's very important for us to know what are the big Roi skills and what are the skills that we should absolutely avoid and not really spend all that time with but let's answer the golden question what are the fundamentals of fortnite aim is one of the most important skills that you must absolutely Master before you can sort of worry about anything else like make sure you can hit a reliable shot now notice I don't say hit a 180 or 190 or 200 all the time it's like if you can trade 100 damage every time you're given an opportunity to do so you're probably good enough it's important not to hit nothing like every time you're given an opportunity if you can trade a good amount of damage and not hit 0 or 30 you'll be well off for sure like this is good back in the day when Tayson was super super good and his prime biggest reason why like he was super good was because his aim was super reliable next skill that we must talk about which is absolutely a fundamental is your edit accuracy so this is something that I absolutely want you guys to focus on because this is something that you don't really care about in practice everyone's trying to go as fast as they can everyone cares about how speedy or flashy or cool they look in practice when you're doing radius piece control map it's really the percentage of times you mess up that matters not really how fast you do it again going back to Jason he was a slow Builder back in the day he was a slow editor back in the day right he didn't really edit that fast the key thing was he would never miss it at it right and so that's what's really important if you understand how to peek and move then really all that matters is like do not miss another if you really care about time and trying to do things efficiently one of the best ways to edit slowly is messing up and edit it adds like a whole two seconds to your sort of editing time right so if you care about speed the best thing you can actually do is up your percentage of time where you actually hit the edit correctly the third skill that I really want you to work on but this is something that's very deep this takes a long time to get really good at and oftentimes it's tied to experience is your game sense right game sense can be broken down into two sort of categories which is fighting game sense and your Grim game sounds as I like to call it I don't really know another term for it but essentially your off-spawn planning your mid game rotates and your sort of game sense revolving around that and your end game sense overall and so like let's to break that down right so fighting game science is essentially your movement your Peaks your trading and your ability to know when to go in want to go out when to play with your team want to sort of split up and do a pinch and all of these things right and so it's really important to understand these things can take a long time to get good at but only if you let it happen that way one of the best ways to get better at fighting super super quickly is to often refer back to the correct way to fight so how do you know what the right way to do it obviously I talk a lot about my channel like the concepts of fighting and but another really simple way to remember how to fight properly is to go on Twitch and watch some streamers and watch how they play Soul Arena and and things like that right so Clarity G Gog these people are really really good and so you could refer to them and make sure you're on the right path because there is absolutely a way where you can sort of Veer off to the side and build bad habits and you know forget to keep yourself in check ask for scrim game sense like if you don't have a popular scrim chord that you play in and that you know the office scrims almost every day um Noble is really good in EU manuscripts so vital scrims is really really good in N A these are really good recommendations in order to get good if you guys have other screen records that you want to sort of share with the community put them down in the comments absolutely but you know scrim often experience is one of those things that builds really really good scrim game sense right some other Concepts that I can talk about is understand the order of priorities right so if there is surge in your game then you should deal with that first um you know building positioning is really really important right and so depend you ask yourself like do you want to go headstone do you want to go Center Zone which one which is important based on the situation that you're in can you even go to Center Zone um because oftentimes people will force center Zone when it's not forcible and then die or lose a lot of math because of it when it was just better that game because they rotated in to just play Edge and rotate in at a later time when there's more enemy builds to use as cover right so it really does depend on the situation but this is what it is right a lot of game senses intuition which is the topic we'll talk about later in the video but I really want you guys to understand it's pattern recognition right put it simply if you're in a scenario very simple scenario where you die it's often the case that you'll eventually learn maybe not the first or second or third time but eventually with enough focused reps in scrim you will eventually learn what the mistake is and Let It Go but this is actually very very common with easy mistakes that you eventually Let It Go Right like for example not having a shotgun show in your Shotgun when you're fighting and so therefore the fix would be to start reloading more frequently so that you do have a shotgun show when you fight so that when you're in an engagement you actually are ready to shoot so this is a very simple example right this is very easy to fix because it's very obvious what the problem is but in more complex situations where it requires more logical thought and critical thinking this is where the issue lies so obviously you know pattern recognition only works if you actually take the time to sort of review and actually come up with the logical answer to the problem that you presented um and so like for example if you're in a scrim and you keep dying endgame and it seems to be the same way maybe you're running it a match too soon um in first moving or second moving and you're having trouble identifying the problem right and so this is where oftentimes game sense will require one of two things the first first thing is usually you know just you identifying the issue successfully and solving it but sometimes you'll be in a situation where you you don't have the knowledge to solve it uh and maybe this is a problem you get stuck at often this is where A New Perspective can help you either a friend or a coach or someone knowledgeable about the game can come in and review your game for you and tell you exactly what's going wrong because oftentimes you know the problem is either too complex for you to solve it or you're just not able to figure out what's going wrong right regardless these are all the problems that come up with games when you're actually trying to solve them and what's important to recognize is like yes it's a slow process and yes it's very easy to solve the simple stuff right and I genuinely believe most of you guys can solve the simple stuff yourself like hey I'm too low here and I should have healed instead of fighting like that's a very basic issue to solve um but like when it gets a little bit more complex when it gets to like end game or mid game rotates and this is where it starts to become a little bit you know Troublesome um this is where you'll probably need a lot more critical thinking to solve the issue uh and a lot more logical thought in my personal opinion so before ending off this first section I do want to let you in on a little bit of a secret this will help you greatly in terms of trying to analyze hey did I do this right did I do this wrong and like how should I fix it whenever you're valid reviewing try your absolute best to not fall into the Trap of result-based thinking because fortnite is absolutely a risk reward game sometimes you do take the risk that you're supposed to and it doesn't work out just because you lost that game doesn't mean you shouldn't do it again in a future game for example if you're low Matson first moving second moving and you try to go for something bold um maybe you could have done it slightly differently sure but it's very important to recognize that like hey it's much better to go for something when you're low match then it's just not not to go for something at all right so try your very best to not look at just results and think like hey it's just right or wrong based on whether I lost or won right and I think it's really important to recognize that in logical thinking trumps here right because sometimes you did do the right move but it still fails this is not a large majority of cases but it's important to recognize when this is and it's important to understand hey like I took the risk that was necessary I did what I needed to do and it didn't work out like for example sometimes in a very big height Meadow it's important to go for height maybe one out of you know four games that you go for height you die you know trying to go for height but then the three other games you absolutely play well understand that risk is a big part of fortnite and it should absolutely be used if you try to think of things way too logically and sort of step by step in fortnite uh I honestly believe that you'll just be too scared to go for anything and that's not good either right so take your decisions with the risk reward in mind for the second topic of this video I do want to talk about your mentality when you practice it's important to understand that a lot of people give the advice of hey I want to be patient I really think it's a long-term game and you know even I've given this advice to myself but what I do to my students is I tell them like look like although you should be patient here's something that you should know problem with being patient and two patient at times is that there's no sense of urgency now this is the key lesson of today's video is the urgency of your practice will lead to Great results like have you ever wondered why it's so hard to play Soul Arena at times you have to reconnect like this is not some to-do list that I'm giving you this is not some sort of chore that you have to do let's quickly compare you know going pro and fortnite with a very simple example which is how to get good grades on a math test which is you know very similar in the regard of like you're getting good at something okay your teacher gives you a practice set of problems which is very very similar to the test and often it's actually the exact same thing as the test except they give you like different numbers for example to truly test whether you know the problems and whether you can apply the concepts you know that you learned in class and so like the best way to get a really really really good performance on your math test is to not actually just complete the math test that you got as a sort of practice sample set right don't just go through the motions you do it and then you don't stop practicing until you get every question right without looking at the answers and then after you can actually complete the problems you're supposed to redo them and make sure you can actually do them within the sort of supposed allotted time that you're given during the math test right these are the steps that you do in order to get a good grade like school is actually really easy right in that regard it's only really easy if you actually check whether you're ready so that's the key thing right like make sure you're ready that's what I was sort of talking about earlier it's like you guys are sort of autopiling through solar Arena because like it's some sort of to-do list like oh I should play solo Arena like in order to be ready for tournament but like no one actually looks at what what's happening to them until Arena and like feels any sort of stress or worry that they're going to do bad in tournaments like that's the sort of problem it's like go into solar Arena every time you die actually go into replays I know like 95 of you guys watching this video Don't Go into replays and go check your like result like why you died in the fight like no one does it I promise you I'm so aware of this you guys genuinely need to go actually figure out why you died fix it don't stop until you fix it and then when you're dropping 10 to 15 kills in solar Arena no problem because your win rate in each fight is like insanely High that's when you can sort of stop and be like hey like my fighting individual fighting is pretty good um I feel like in a dual setting now like I can actually carry my own way and not let my teammate down this is very important so the lesson that we've learned is quite simply checking whether you're actually ready for the tournaments right it's like if you're losing every scrim like what do you think is gonna happen in the tournament that's like doing the math practice set problems getting every question wrong and then going to sleep peacefully somehow like one final thing I'll say about this topic before we move on to the third one in this video is I'm fully aware that rage is an issue in Seoul Arena most likely but also in scrims right and so how do you fix their age issue my personal shot at this honestly is the fact that you should just genuinely realize how much time is being wasted through the Raging it doesn't offer anything productive if you're getting off every two to three fights in Soul Arena and if you're just checked out after two scrims like this is the the important thing right if you're trying to be the productive person that you want to be and you're trying to solve all your issues before the tournament comes around it's in your best interest not to rage be mad for your 5-10 to 20 seconds and then get over it like that's it like I don't know like what else to tell you like you need to control yourself and just actually focus on the task at hand now finally the third and arguably the most important topic of this video is about intuition now for those of you guys who don't know what intuition is let me sort of explain it to you two different ways first the definition of intuition intuition is simply knowing what to do without actually consciously thinking about it and this is actually made only possible by pattern recognition from past experiences usually a similar past experience okay so this is very important before we move on I just want to quickly explain why intuition is such a valuable skill especially in a game like fortnite number one reason is absolutely speed right when you consciously think about every single decision and why you're making the decision an in-game you're struggling with speed you're trying to do things too slow you're hesitating you're doubting yourself this is not good you you know you might be second guessing yourself it's very important you need speed in a game like fortnite especially when it comes to end game and even some big game rotates honestly right and so it's very important that you need to come to a feeling not a logical thought in this scenario especially one in performance like a tournament right you need speed at times and it's very very valuable to come up with a decent decision with speed rather than hesitate on the really really good decision or the correct answer theoretically if you've ever wondered why we practice or scrim at all this is exactly why we're trying to create those memories or past experience so that in the future when we go into the tournament and a similar memory arises what do you think we're going to do we've learned our lesson we don't like losing we've lost three times four times in a row in the past to this exact same mistake and usually I would hope that we don't make the same mistake in the tournament another way to think about intuition is an example so if you guys still don't understand what intuition is not to worry here's a great example of intuition in our day-to-day life when you're walking do you actually think about left foot forward right foot forward left foot forward right before no you don't you don't you just don't think of it that way right you think of just hey I need to go from point A to point B because in our head it's modularized right and we thought about it and when we were kids like okay how do I actually walk for sure we thought about it then so in practice and getting better at it you need to think about it consciously um but when you're actually good at it already you don't think about it anymore it becomes intuition another example of this is if you're a driver right so most of you guys maybe don't have your driver's license yet I totally understand that but let's say you're driving a car why do you break why do you slow down the car when it comes down to the situation where the car in front of you has their brake lights on sometimes your mind is focused on something else and you're you know you're talking to your friend on the phone and you'll still break and slow down when you see the brake lights in front of you appear so again this is intuition because you've been in this sort of scenario before where maybe in driving school or practice you've been in a situation where the brake lights in front of you has happened and the car is slowly approaching you because it's slowing down and you're still going at a rapid speed you'll press the brake right but during practice it requires some conscious thought and eventually you learn and you have to understand fortnite is genuinely no different just because it's a video game doesn't mean it's any different you have to understand think about driving as if it's like a video game like the windshield is a monitor the driving wheel is a controller it's the exact same thing we have a reaction to some sort of thing that we observe on the Monitor and that's it right and so this is the exact same thing that we're doing here as well if we practice enough we'll eventually you know run into most of the most common scenarios enough where we'll just eventually get good right wrong that's probably not gonna happen and the reason why it won't happen is you know it's not that simple you can't just get good you have to sort of consciously think while you're practicing this is why I oftentimes suggest to review and reflect and think about what you did wrong and try to figure out what you did wrong because I think it's really important because like for example if I were to sit in the call with you and try to like tell you exactly what you did wrong and I just take over the whole process for you you don't have to do any of the thinking which is oftentimes somewhat you know painful and you know people don't like to do it people are lazy I totally get it but it's important to recognize this is the process that actually sort of puts it into memory for you right so trying to think of what went wrong if you are able to figure it out yourself you'll probably remember it easier makes sense so like why do you think the teachers don't give you the answer in math class it's the exact same reason they're trying to get it sort of locked in your memory and if you have the process of figuring it out and you get it successfully you'll probably remember it much easier during the test and in this case during your scrim I want you to figure it out for yourself is the critical thinking process is really important for remembering it later on in the game sometimes when I'm coaching I like to ask a lot of questions rather than just tell them straight up what the answer is right like to lead or guide them to the answer not just give them the answer and so this is really important guys this is what intuition is right and so it's important to recognize what intuition is because if you you know if you think about the pros when they're going into a very very crazy situation in like an end game clutch they're not there thinking like oh my God what's the risk reward of this situation like and what should I do here and you know sometimes they won't even think about like anything they'll just be locked in right that's what locked in means right the adrenaline is rushing they don't have time to think consciously all they're doing is referring back to their past experiences in their head using that to come up with decisions and that's it like quite literally that's it like even myself someone who I would argue is more logical if I'm in a Solo clutch situation and I'm trying to clutch it up for my team I don't think in game I don't think in practice I might try to consciously think because I think that's necessary for building that intuition faster but in the tournament I I just go locked in right that's really really important to recognize don't try to overthink in tournaments I've tried it myself in the past it is absolutely not a great idea if you don't have the time to come up with the decisions right obviously in mid game you know mid game you know coming up with the rotates and stuff sure because you have the time for it right but in endgame you absolutely don't have time for it some rotates honestly you don't have time for it let's say you need surge right you need a lot of search spend all that time trying to get all that AR damage or The Surge damage in general and then later on you have like 10 seconds to figure out your mid game rotate and that's it like in that case you have to refer to your intuition which is oftentimes igos and coaches are not the exact same thing because coaches sometimes need more time to come up with the correct answer whereas igls are really really good but coming up with an answer on the spot that's half decent or 80 good and that is way more valuable than coming up with the actual correct answer which kind of leads me into the last subtopic be a little bit more confident about your calls it's okay if you don't get the number one correct answer I'm not asking you to actually do that you just need to have good quality decisions and that's it right sometimes honestly if you make a bad decision but both of you guys are in on it it can work right so just understand whatever play you make just make it together with confidence and most of the time it will actually work which is why sometimes when you've already Pros they'll do something theoretically wrong but it still works out because they're so confident in their play like they'll go in on it together right and so that's key that's very very important do not sort of be split on decisions there's a whole reason you have an igl listen to the igl obviously the writer can make a call here or there but it's important to just stick to one call and be on it 100 before we end this video let's give a couple examples of fortnite in-game intuition okay very simple example I'm in front of this box what am I very scared of if there's an enemy in here my positioning is horrible that's first off but I don't think of it this way what I see is I'm adjacent to a wall that's not mine this wall is a part of a full box naturally I would think there's someone in there and because that's the case I would immediately get out of the way because I'm under threat being full box and so that's the key word right there right it's threat absolutely you need to understand that threat is sort of the feeling that you get when you try to come up with the correct answer using intuition either way guys sort of a different video here I did not want to make that sort of algorithmic chapter 4 content this is why I'm sort of struggling on like making content in general is because I don't want to ship post I don't want to make that sort of content that you see everywhere on YouTube want to be different not for the sake of being different but for the sake of actually helping you guys genuinely right and for the guys that actually care about this the most and actually care about competitive and care about improving and actually you know have a goal of becoming a pro one day this video will absolutely be the resource that you need to get better thank you guys so much for watching this video and I will see you guys next time

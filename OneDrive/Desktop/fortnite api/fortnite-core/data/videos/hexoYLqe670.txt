there's a completely unknown fortnite player who has been out placing and destroying the best professional players in the world this season he's won an fncs divisional cup won his group in the fncs semi-finals made the entire country of France hate him won two of the six solo cash cups and almost one fncs grand finals now similar to some of the world's best players he's even received some cheating accusations this player's name is deis now deis is a player who's been competing since 2020 however he only got his first earnings back in January of 2023 with the introduction of the solar Victory cups now in that format all he had to do was qualify to the finals and then win a game and you'd win $100 turns out that Demis is quite the solo player and he was able to win 12 solo Victory Cup games and $1,200 before ever earning any team mode now I had heard about how good Deus was not because I'm a noer but because my friend coach Harry is Jump forward a few months after this conversation and all of a sudden de is at the top of every single leaderboard and it seems to be a massive part of why so many French fans are sending death threats and hate mail towards any polish player you see this year's fncs Global Championship is held in Leon in France you see for most of this season Camy SE and Hari who are polish players have been fighting off spawn at Lost Lake against Akira xiz and pisai French players now in order to make it to the fncs Grand finals the biggest Tournament of the Season you need to come in the top 10 in your group however these two teams were in different groups which meant that they were both going to land at the same drop spot completely uncontested now this means it's significantly easier for you to get into the top 10 of the leaderboards meaning that it's going to be much easier for you to make it to Grand finals and if both of them are in different groups this means it'll be much easier for both of them to qualify and get a top 10 the result of this is they'll both be contesting each other and fighting off spawn in Grand finals and more than likely won't do well in the one tournament where it really matters because they'll either die half of their games or have other teams rotate in and killed them that's where Demis comes in see this season he's playing with pix and darh and they usually land at pumped power coincidentally they were also in the same group as French team Akira Xs and pisai now pump power was going to be contested by another team so rather than fighting them there deus's team decided to land at Lost Lake contesting Akira Xs and pide now many of the French fans were upset about this because they're clearly thinking that CI SE and Hari another Polish team have got their polish friends to change for to land on Akira xwe and Pai to ensure they don't qualify to the Grand finals to make things easier for Cami say and Hari whether or not this is true we will never know but what we do know is they absolutely bossed this Lobby now if you know anything about polish players in fortnite they don't really have the best reputation for being the fragi of players if anything their reputation is usually being incredibly smart being able to understand position creating great strategies rotating incredibly well and are generally regarded as some of the smartest and most consistent fortnite players of all time but their fighting skill is nearly always their weakest link for Demus pix and dar this is not an issue their worst game in this tournament was a top eight and they even managed to win the final game with 17 elims out of their 50 total elim in this tournament Demis had 22 of these having some insane major clutch ups for example in game number two where picks ended up going down early he was able to clutch up a top two with seven elims they won their group and qualifying through to their first fncs Grand finals whereas the contesting team of Akira poto XS who they had been bossing off spawn ended up in 28 not qualifying funly enough they did manage to then qualify through the last chance major by winning a game and contested Cami say and Harry and as predicted with both teams contesting each other they both did badly but deus's Trio with pix and dar did incredibly well so what is it that makes him so good if you watch any of deus's gameplay you'll immediately notice how incredibly good his movement is take this kill against an absolute NPC sorry NPC if you're watching this notice how after hitting a shot onto other player he swings around the right hand side and grabs a wall in front of him he does not however just keep running straight into the other players box instead he edits a bottom right forti edit and swings to the left a little bit to ensure he's hidden behind it if you watch this from the other players perspective he is 100% hidden behind this edit which allows him to hit a big shot he then resets the edit and immediately start sprinting round to the other side of the player since you can edit while sprinting he edits that wall and slides into the box making it incredibly hard for him to get hit allowing him to easily finish off the other player who is just completely lost when I was one V oneing Veno for my previous video he said that if he's in a box with another player when he shoots his shotgun rather than switching to his assault rifle he'll Sprint and slide to try and avoid being hit after that and then go for another pump shot it seems like more and more the best players are implementing Sprint slides into their gameplay when you're in a one TI radius and this completely makes sense because fortnite has not the best servers and there's usually quite a lot of sync the player who moves the fastest will usually have a good peers Advantage I will do a whole video on this eventually so by Sprint sliding the opponent becomes visible to you way faster than you become a visible to the opponent so even where in this scenario he's sliding into a left hand Peak he actually has the peer Advantage because he's moving so fast plus he's so low to the ground it's just really difficult to hit him now if you go back and watch that clutch where he ended up second with seven eliminations from the fncs group stages you can see him do this mechanic all of the time in end game this mechanic can also be used to to slide straight into people's boxes such as here where he gets the 29th Elum out of these 31s where if you time the wall beat correctly you can just phas straight in because you're moving faster but I think the coolest use of this is when Demis is getting W keyed here and after getting hit he turns Sprints jumps resets the wall places a ramp all whilst flying backwards but because he has this Sprint jump momentum that he's moving backwards this actually allows him to slide down the ramp spin around and create another full box with a ramp inside which in a matter of one one second creates three layers between him and the other player who's trying to fight him this gives him time to heal and then of course he can just edit through all of these builds and then kills the player but there's way more examples than just Sprint sliding take this clip for example from the literal next elim where he gets doubles over the other player now most people jump down into the box which is extremely risky and since the other player drops back through his other wall Deus actually has the awareness to walk along the other player's wall and Crouch to try and get an angle unfortunately he is not successful here and kills the player in another way but this micro movement awareness I genuinely don't think I've ever seen from any other player another Trend I noticed with Demis is he's insanely good at getting doubles over other players in this scenario the other player boxes up and Demus notices that he's only connected by two walls so he just sprays these out to knock the other player down now most people in the scenario when that player is falling they're going to try and take a shot and then grab a wall between him and the other player but instead what Demus doeses is he shoots a shot to get damage off and then immediately elevates himself up one layer at this point the other player is really busy trying to grab those walls that most people would take which means Demis can freely grab the floor and The Cone above the player then all he needs to do is double edit down couple walls in a cone and a pump shot to finish him off and one of the reasons he can do this so easily is because he's a really good read on what other players are going to do take this scenario for example where cring here is getting Lobby focused by a bunch of players now most people would just try and smack on the wall behind him and take it but instead he reads the cringe is going to go down a layer and by the time he does Demus has already boxed that side up and is already picking axing on that wall giving the other players zero time to react and this elim is also just another great showcasing of his good movement fundamentals as he keeps swinging behind the peanut butter at it rather than just running into the box and trying to finish off cringe quickly and I think the best way to describe his fighting play style overall is just calm and patient in this end game he kills three pros Vico Cami and Thomas HD but the one onto Thomas HD is particularly interesting he's in no way afraid to tank any storm here whatsoever and despite the pressure of a 1V one scenario and the ticking storm damage he still takes the time to make sure he's making a good angle and taking a good right hand Peak and this ultimately wins him the game these things are also a positive feedback loop where the more calm damus is the easier it is to read the opponent and the easier it is to read the opponents the less you have to panic and therefore the calmer you can be ultimately I think this positive feedback loop is one of the reasons why Demis is as good as he is but interestingly having good Awareness on the other player is what has made some people to believe that Demis is cheating in his 31 elim solo cash Cup game he manages to get an elim and then immediately turns around and full boxes up above another player clearly knowing exactly where he is he breaks through the floor and this fellow polish player lives up to the Polish reputation of not really being able to fight and just kind of jumps around the box and dies now this Tik Tok seems to make it seem like this is one of the most suspicious things of all time how did he know he was hiding in such a good hiding spot that could never be found he's clearly using ESP to see through walls or he has the void Boon and he just got an elim and you can literally see the effect leave the the player's body as he gets eliminated and highlight the other player making it the freest elim of all time there's also a point later in this Tik Tok where this guy's like how could he possibly see someone when he was in this cone how would he ever know he's there when he literally just saw the person in the cone as it was just building earlier and then another clip after he's like how did you know this player was in this cone but when Demus approaches the box you can see him take his cone out and check the cones if someone's inside of it you'll see a lock symbol in the center of your screen so Dems can clearly see that there's someone just sitting in this cone at this exact moment now 200 th000 people saw this Tik Tok and maybe think that Demus is cheating because of this which is a real shame and I'm not going to say he isn't but I've seen zero clips that make it think that he is and the more I watch him the more I realize this guy's just booger now obviously dropping a 31 bomb against OP level players in the first game of a solo cash cup is still impressive but I think the most impressive thing about Demis when he fights in trios with pix and dar is the strategies that they come up with to fight other top level pro teams in the fncs semi-finals as we already mentioned they were contesting the French team of Akira Pai and Xs and in this particular game they were playing this fight defensively whereas the French team were the ones aggressing them as soon as this fight commences all three of them immediately Crouch at the exact same time almost making it really difficult for the French team to figure out exactly where they are and which angles they should take after a couple of back and forwards Demis and dar make an amazing play where they bait the other team they tarp over to the other building whilst pix is still crouching down below the French team now thinks they've all rotated over which allows pix to sneak up on top and beam exqueeze he drops down and Falls straight into darh who wipes him out this now becomes a 3v2 and Demus is able to get the elim on both of the other two players so this was a great bait and switch which allowed picks to get behind the team in another game they did a really nice setup where darh went on top of the main building picks ramped up on the right side to make sure they couldn't escape and Demis was on the south which basically forced Pai xque and Akira to either rotate to the North or just fight them since they were trapped inside the building this actually allowed Demus just to spend a ton of time looting and get a good mat Advantage they then baited that they left the fight by all teleporting South but then immediately teleported back up north and created a beautiful pinch where Demis was flanking around the left and pix and dar were on the right hand side completely sandwiching Akira and egg squeeze together into the middle which allowed them to jump in and just finish the fight unfortunately this footage is really laggy thank you replay mode as I've been recording this video fncs Grand finals has been going on and they've been actually contending for first place Unfortunately they weren't able to win because this video would have been to cinema but demo picks and dar were absolutely popping off and were really impressive for a first time Grand schem interesting to see their progression across the entire year now in this video I covered a lot about how Demus has had some cheating accusations which I think don't hold any weight but way more people have accused Peter bot of cheating and you can see my full analysis of how Peter bot beat the allegations by clicking on this video

without further ado let's hop into it basically the idea of good crosshair placement is moving your mouse or controller in the most optimal way possible to do editing and building so this means like you can look here when i'm confirming an edit you don't want to do wide edits you don't want to do big movements you want to make it as tight as possible by tightening up the crosshair placement on your edits your editing speed will increase so doing this is crucial to getting good and fast mechanics and the same thing applies with building when you're building you want to have your crosshair placement as tight as possible so let's say while i'm tunneling here you don't want to swing your mouse left and right like crazy you want to get that tightest movement possible to place all the builds by doing that you'll be able to better understand everything going on around you in fights and in endgames because you won't be moving your screen all over the place it won't be hard to see what's going on so basically to get this good crosshair placement there's a couple things you have to do the biggest thing is gaining more control with your input whether it be keyboard and mouse or controller this just comes with practice but one of the best ways to get better control is by practicing your aim because if you can get really consistent aim and really steady tracking on controller or keyboard and mouse that means you have pretty good control over your input in the description i'll link my covax routine and i'll also link my favorite aim trainer maps in creative mode of fortnite you can just hop into those in your warm up to improve your aim and that'll help you improve your mouse control which will help you improve your crosshair placement so that's the first thing and the main reason that you need good mouse control is so that you're not all shaky and inconsistent in your mouse movements if you don't have good control over your mouse you might accidentally move your crosshair too far and that's bad crosshair placement makes sense now in general your crosshair placement is going to improve just the more you play the game and that applies with your input control as well but some of the best ways to get better faster are by free building a lot doing a ton of 1v1s and trying to go as fast as possible in your 1v1s also learning new building combos and then running raiders mechanical practice map but the most important one in my opinion is aim training so all that stuff that i just talked about is going to help you improve your mouse control and your crosshair placement but the majority of this video is actually going to be on a topic that's more complicated towards crosshair placement we're going to be talking about how to get fluidity in your building editing and aiming one of the most important parts of crosshair placement in my opinion is being able to line up your crosshair with the next task in the most efficient way possible basically what i mean is that when i'm building i try to get my movement of my crosshair as fluid as possible i confirm one edit and my crosshair is instantly in the position of the next edit and now this sounds obvious but i'm going to be giving you drills on how you can actually improve your fluidity in your gameplay the best way to get better crosshair placement while doing certain building combos is to practice those combos on repeat you will gradually get faster as you learn that fluidity and the muscle memory of these different building combos a lot of these moves you're already going to know but i'm going to help you understand them on a deeper level to get them better starting off with triple edits let's talk about the best way you can improve your crosshair placement and speed look at how i do it here my crosshair barely moves while doing the triple edit so all i really need to do to get it faster is press the edit button faster basically when i finish my double edit my crosshair is already lined up to start that last edit so then i just need a slight movement to finish it i started with triple edits because this is the idea minimizing the movement for every single task if you do all these drills at the start of your warm-up until you get them down perfectly that's how you're gonna get good crosshair placement the second move is a triple edit out the side it's the same idea with every build task there is a minimal way to move your mouse to complete the task optimally so you can see with this one i'm gradually changing my direction of my running so that i can keep my crosshair pointed at the next edit and where the next edit begins the third move you can practice is doing a ramp into a wall edit notice how every time i confirm the ramp edit my crosshair is immediately moving to the most optimal place to start the wall at it and vice versa so when i drag that ramp at it down i'm moving to the left or right based on where i'm going to edit the wall another good thing that you can practice is starting your edit in the most optimal place to do a quick so rather than always doing your wallet it from top down if your crosshair is placed at the bottom start from the bottom up the next move you can throw into your warm up is practicing throwing high walls in front of you and getting that crosshair placement down if you find yourself missing a certain wall when you're doing a high wall just practice getting the crosshair placement down and creative by doing this drill this will get you more consistent with it and you can learn exactly where you need to place your crosshair to get that high wall that way you don't have to fling your mouse all the way to the top of the screen you can just put it as far up as you need to claim the high wall if that makes sense at this point you can start mixing and matching these different drills to get a little bit further practice you can see i'm throwing the triple edits out the side and the triple edits just straight up into the high walls as well just to get that extra advanced practice so the fifth thing you can practice is tunneling now the thing about tunneling and this is good to know is that you can tighten up your crosshair placement while tunneling so much by keeping your crosshair kind of level in the center of the screen if you go into creative and put your crosshair in the dead center of the wall and just move slightly up and down you'll see that you can get the top floor and the bottom floor without barely moving your mouse and this can help you keep your crosshair more level while tunneling and that'll make your tunnels faster and more consistent this is really key to know because if you're just flicking your mouse all over the place to do a tunnel you'll find yourself brainlessly tunneling without any vision of where you're going so practice tightening up that tunneling and get that crosshair placement less crazy and more concise and that'll help you be able to scout ahead when you're rotating zones and just be more consistent in your tunneling and your vision in endgame sometimes in laggy lobbies i find myself flicking the mouse around trying to complete one box and i just completely lose sight of where i'm headed this will help fix that lastly you can practice tunneling with the cones because the cones are slightly different than floors because they place further so getting that practice in with cones as well and switching layers with cones is good to add to your warm up the sixth move is a really good box fight move with cones if you practice doing this drill just like i'm doing here your crosshair placement with cones will improve a bunch if you look slightly over a wall you can place a cone over the wall so let's say hypothetically someone's trying to ramp up and you get them coned then you can just box out the side with cones just like i'm doing in this drill and you'll get them boxed before they know what happens pre-boxing someone with cones like i'm doing here is the best way because you can place cones further away so you can get them boxed from further back move number seven is triple edits down again pay attention to my crosshair placement and all these drills that's the thing that should be standing out to you most notice how one edit just fluidly leads to the next edit that's the skill you should be focusing on if you choose to do this warm-up i just do that extra cone flip because it just adds a little spice and it's fun move number eight is practicing flipping cones while running by this is good if you're placing a cone next to an enemy's wall you want to flip that cone up and claim the front wall that way they can't get you boxed there because you counter piece that front wall literally you can choose any build move in the game that you can't do consistently or fast and make it into a drill that you can practice in your warm up number nine is just practicing doing low wall full boxes this is good for when you claim a wall an end game with a duo and you're trying to run in and jump in on them you got to get consistent with these low wall edits because that's the best way to fully expose the enemy this next one is one that i need to practice a ton you flip the cone up place a wall up a layer and then edit through that and box that layer if somebody's up there you can get them full box with this move and just get in on them i mess this up all the time by accidentally pre-editing my wall because my crosshair placement isn't good with this yet so i just run this drill when i hop on the last one of the day is just another random one this is actually a pretty useful form of tunneling and end game you just extend a ramp and a floor and it blocks your top and your sides and your teammate can follow right behind you if you guys choose to run these drills in your warm up for a while come back like two weeks later and let me know if your crosshair placement gets better with these moves i'll catch you guys in the next one peace

today I'll be going over 19 of the best tips to become better at fortnite whether you're brand new to the game or I've played it since the first day came out this video will have something for you my first tip is one of the most important tips I can give out to anyone wanting to improve at the game that is that being a consistent Builder and editor is way way better than being fast mechanically nowadays every player aspiring to be good is grinding their hearts out to be as fast as Peter bot but what they don't understand is that Peter bot's speed is worthless if you can't use it to consistently punish opponent's mistakes anyone can do fast triple edits and flashy builds but very few players can do these impressive builds and edits while maintaining 100% awareness of the opponent they're fighting the clue here is therefore to only focus on two things never ever not even for a millisecond losing track of the opponent when fighting and secondly trying your absolute best to not fail a build or edit if you over time maintain this mentality you will improve tremendously faster compared to someone who's only playing to improve their mechanical SP speed in addition when following this way of thinking instead of fixating on the fact that you want to be fast you'll naturally develop into a fast mechanical player over time a fast mechanical player with good awareness in contrast to what 95% of players are today which is fast mechanical players with zero awareness for tip number two I recommend checking out today's video partner hone a software that allows you to super easily tweak your PC for better fps and less input delay to download H simply go to the description below click the first link and hit the download button then when it's downloaded go through

they have an option to turn on gaming optimizations and slightly higher up they have a setting called disable windows power throttling that is a setting that is absolutely crucial to have disabled if you're playing on a laptop in addition to this they have game specific tweaks so if I head to the left hand side here and go down to game optimizations and click in on fortnite with h premium I can activate H's performance mode by the click of a button and this makes my game feel buttery smooth if any one of the tweaks don't feel worth it to you then you're just one click away from disabling them when I use H my FPS not only increases by about 30% but the performance is also way more consistent which makes playing tournaments customs and of course creative a lot EAS is here and the beauty of it all is that it is free to use but with a slight cabat of only 10 optimizations with premium you get unlimited optimizations and no ads check it out in the description below or the pin comment for tip number three you want to find out how much time you have to play on a day today basis and make a practice routine based on that you see how you should practice to improve depends heavily on how many hours you can play daily if you only have one hour to play you want to exclusively play Creative as the amount of repetitions you'll get in by playing normal games for 1 hour will be so limited to the point where you'll never become particularly good at the game if you have something like 4 hours to play you can over time become exceptionally good you'll have time to play Creative ranked and Customs if you're not already sure about how much time you actually have to put into the game every week ask yourself how many hours a day on average can I truly put in and how can I get the most quality repetitions of practice out of those hours next up we have the tip that changed my way of improving forever and that is always blaming yourself when losing matches when I first started playing fortnite I would get so mad when my Duo partner got eliminated in a fight I would say not so kind the things to him and honestly just make him feel not great but as I kept playing the game trying my best to get the highest level I could I understood that my impact on how my teammates play is so heavily limited that I'm better off just always blaming myself when we go down in a match if my Duo died in a game I would instead of using my brain power to blame him think about how I could have won that 1 V2 this mentality led me to improve way more in comparison to my previous self who never would even think about how I could have won my 1v2 because I couldn't as I was channeling my focus elsewhere at being mad at my friend early on in my career I was also very quick to blame bad luck if I played an offs spawn fight I got a bad weapon and lost that fight I would say things like oh I was super unlucky and again I wouldn't even think about what I could have done differently to Win It guys the harsh reality is nobody cares about your excuses and the only thing you should think about is improving so after every death take full accountability for you going down and think about what you could have done to win the situation instead of losing it it doesn't matter if your teammates true to fight or you got inhumanly unlucky take some time reflect upon what you could have done differently and over time you will become a different player completely trust me moving on we have something I'm embarrassed to admit it took me 5 years to understand how the hitboxes in fortnite work in my first 5 years of playing I thought my best bet was to always aim at the opponent's head when shooting and over time I would hope for become a better and better aimer what this meant was that when I was going for AR beams and stuck in boxes with enemies I would use my spray weapons so ARs and SMGs and try to track the opponent's head perfectly and very often I would lose those 50/50s even though I felt like my aim was really good but one day I realized that when going for beams and when inside of boxes with opponents you're always better off exclusively aiming at the chest instead of going for head shots this applies to both controller and keyboard mouse players the reason aiming at the chest is way better is first because the chest hit box is exactly five times bigger than the head hit box or in simpler terms five times easier to H and as we know the head shot damage of all weapons in fortnite is far less than 5x that of the body shot damage so by doing some math you have a head hip box that is very difficult to hit consistently and it usually delivers a 1.5x to 2x higher damage output than just going for body shots in addition to this in fortnite you of course also have balloon which means that your bullets don't always go exactly where you're aiming they can spread randomly within your Crosshair so when in a box or going for a mid to long range beam when you use an SMG or ar going for head shot can and will cause a lot of your bullets although you have totally perfect aim to miss the opponent's head I hope I explained why it's so much better going for chest shots rather than head shots with SMGs and ARS in an understandable way because this right here is something I wish somebody had told me when I started playing the game it would have saved me thousands of last 50/50s lastly I just need to note that this of course only applies to SMGs and ARs and not shotguns with shotguns you want to exclusively aim at that unless of course the opponent is extremely low another thing that took me insanely long to understand and this was because there was not a single YouTuber streamer or even Pro player that ever publicly explained it in detail was how to do perfect rightand Peaks so what I one day over 2 years ago figured out was that when you go into the edit menu to do your edit a lot of people including me before I figur this out thought the gray boxes would be an indicator of how the wall would look once the edit was confirmed but when I sat in Creative I understood that if I used the gray boxes as a measure of how to do a perfect peanut butter edit or a window edit I would get hit 10 out of 10 times when fighting decent players so then I kept thinking about what I needed to do and then I for the first time in 5 years spotted this gray line that goes from the top left to the bottom right this gray line is how the edit will actually look once the edit is confirmed what that meant was that if I took my time to run into the wall and made sure my head was protected under this line before confirming my edits I could not gete when I made a video about this on December 22nd 2022 a ton of people commented that they had never heard about this either but this single simple Discovery ended with me becoming someone phenomenally annoying to fight after a few weeks time what I did to practice these perfect Peaks was very slowly do the peanut butter and then I made sure I was fully protected under the gry line before confirming by doing this thousands of times I built it into my muscle memory and although it felt far from natural the first few hundred times I did it it ended with me being able to do it as casually as doing a normal peanut butter edit just when I did it I was impossible to hit whereas the vast majority of other players allow themselves even to this day still be hit now I want to note a few things to be a 100% in hitable you need to have a cone below your feet and a flat above your head addition to be truly unhitable you need to eliminate the opponent when shooting the shot after the peak if you do this and you shoot the shot quickly you can't get hit not even if the opponent has aot this is due to fortnite's 30 tick server system which means that when jumping you'll have the advantage over your opponent to shoot and eliminate him if you do this right hand Peak with the perfect setup so a cone below you and a flat above you and you shoot AA and don't eliminate the opponent you can get hit although it will be remarkably difficult for the guy you're fighting to hit you the same rules also apply for window edits and the top three Square edits if you do these edits and before confirming you make sure your character model is protected by the gray lines you'll do an infinitely better Peak compared to fuse the gray boxes as an indicator of where you need to stand to be protected if you're playing on edit on release the easiest way to do perfect Peaks is to run all the way into the wall and then making the edit when practicing this in Creative you want to run all the way into the wall do the edit stand completely still and look where the peanut butter or window edit ended up being confirmed are you protected or are you not if you're not protected like I know many of you will not be you need to slowly and surely change your muscle memory into doing this edit and movement in a way that ends with you being protected by the wall be super intentional when practicing focus on being accurate make doing good Peaks effortless for your muscle memory and remember if you confirm this edit as little as 1 millisecond to early you will get hit when fighting good players and I'm not exaggerating the difference of how visible you are to the opponent completely changes from one millisecond to the other when it comes to confirming the peanut butter right hand Peak again and for the last time you must make sure you are protected by the gry line before confirming and if you are an edit on release you need to make sure You' ran all the way into the wall and that you can't even run a millimeter closer to it before confirming the addit this way you'll have the wall as protection and instead of giving your opponent an easy shot to H you will truly challenge him and give him an incredibly difficult one for the final thing that took me way too long to understand we have the true importance of having 200 Health back in the day I used to think that the difference between say 180 and 200 hp wasn't a big deal if I had a splash and 180 HP I would not pop my Splash when going into a fight I would rather get the elimination on my opponent so that I would get the siphon but 180 HP is 10% less than 200 so what that in theory means is that my opponent can have a 9% worse aim than me and still win a potential 50 50 of course in real games it doesn't exactly work like that but it paints a very good picture as to how much impact just a few Shield or health points can have for a fight as most of you know I'm also a competitive Enthusiast I love fortnite competitive and what really took me up a level in terms of skill was just always being on 200 Health in end games before understanding the importance of 200 health I would often play End games on 160 170 HP and be just as confident as when I was on 200 what would then happen when I played in High ELO games against good players was that I would need a Refresh on someone jump in their box and they would of course be totally full health and even though my aim was far from bad I would lose the duel thanks to being on 20% less HP and the worst part of it all was that I would sometimes make these plays with a big pot in my inventory or another healing item that could get me up to 200 health because I didn't think it mattered all that much being on 200 Health when fighting as well essentially allows you to make more mistakes and still win the fight on on 200 hp you are extremely difficult to eliminate on 150 you are not so the next time you're playing an end game or a fight ask yourself can I give myself a better odds here by going up to 200 hp trust me guys pay attention to your health in the coming weeks and see just how much easier this game becomes when you understand the true importance of having 100 health and 100 shield now one of the most important tips I can give is to play Creative against better players than yourself or at least stay away from playing against the same lowle player every day the goal here is to play against someone you lose to because when you lose you get challenged to a way higher standard compared to when you're easily winning how you find someone good to play against depends on what level you currently play on if you're new to the game hopping into matchmaking on a popular 1 V one map will be more than enough to get challenged but if you play at a relatively good level I recommend the following after a tournament has concluded go on fortnite tracker.com and look at the top 200 from that tournament preferably something like a trios cash cup or an CS week then go in on someone who's named something you do not recognize check if they have their X account Instagram or twitch connected and if they do send them a DM and ask to play this way you'll be able to play with someone who has proven that he is quite good at the game and it's truly a hack to improve if you're someone who's looking to do better in fortnite competitive naturally if you are a player on the comeup I recommend trying to find players within the top 200 of a tournament that's also on a come up someone who doesn't have a lot of PR and achievements these players are also way more likely to say yes to play with and against you on a bit of the same topic for Tip N we have forcing yourself to play uncomfortable situations one of the easiest ways I have found to play uncomfortable situations is by playing maro's 1 V2 clutch map this is in no way sponsored or anything like that by martos or anyone that's Affiliated by that map but I've found that grinding this map helps you out so much especially if you can play it against someone who's relatively good when playing these 1 V2s I'm so uncomfortable because I'm terrible at winning one V2s against good players what then ends up happening is I make a major mistake and I get punished for that misplay that can be either a failed edit a bad Peak going for something with the wrong timing or something completely else and these are the exact scenarios we want to put ourselves in when practicing scenarios where we make a lot of mistakes ones where we have a ton of room for improvement because if you over time consistently do this those uncomfortable situations will no longer be uncomfortable and the result of that is that you have become a much much better player naturally 1 V2 clutch situations aren't the only situations people find uncomfortable maybe you're someone who's super good at playing one one build fights but all your friends are better than you at sonone Wars in that case you should grind some 1 V one to 4v4 son War because that is where you have a lot to learn and improve I hope you get what I'm trying to put down here because when I first understood this I was for the first time in months able to break through yet another skill cap moving on to another thing that can help you break through a skill cap we have fighting your weaknesses by recording 20 creative deaths or recording 20 ranked matches and finding out what your main cause of going down was this right here is seriously such a good way of finding out what you need to do to become better because often it's quite difficult to know what your weaknesses actually are I personally like to do both of these things every once in a while the creative part I play 2v2 son Wars until I've died 20 times and I record every thing using Nvidia Shadow play when I've gone down 20 times I look at my first death and write down the cost of me dying on a Google Docs document if I missed an edit I type failed edit if I get peace controlled I type obvious movement if I miss a shot I type bad aim and so forth I do this for all 20 deaths and simply type down the numbers 1 to 20 on my Doc's document when I've done all of that work and written down the reason behind every single death I look and see if one weakness happens more than others did I die mainly to bad edits aim movement or whatever by doing this you'll have a relatively objective answer to what your true weaknesses are maybe it turns out all you need to do is become more consistent at editing or maybe it turns out you're just a little bit too obvious in the way you move and build as said I also like doing this in ranked because for some reason my play style in creative and in ranked isn't totally similar to make things a little bit more interesting I need to share one tip right now regarding what you can do outside of the game to instantly become much better at fortnite and that is to enable something called XMP for Intel oriented motherboards or docp for AMD oriented motherboards XMP is a setting that allows your RAM to run at its actual full speed it's a 95 out of 100 scenarios totally safe to turn on although it is classified as an overclock with a few exceptions for older PCS however if you have a medium to high-range PC from the last few years XMP is a setting that you absolutely must have on it will make your PS a ton better your input delay will feel non-existent and enabling the setting will essentially make you a few percentage points better instantly to turn it on we first want to hit our Windows button and R at the same time type in Ms info 32 and hit enter when the window opens up you want to make your way down to baseboard manufacturer right here as you can see it says RPL for me for you it might say something along the lines of microstar international which is the full name of the brand MSI you might have a gigabyte motherboard Asus or it might be a totally different brand what I recommend when you find the brand of motherboard you have is to search up on YouTube how to turn on XMP with an MSI Motherboard if you have an MSI one of course and so forth however I will go over how to generally speaking turn on XMP right now so chances are high you'll understand how to do it from my simple tutorial although we might not have the exact same setup for our bias to turn on XMP we need to turn off our PC once the computer is fully shut down we want to go ahead and turn it on again while it boots we want to spam click our F2 or delete buttons it can also be buttons like F10 F12 or Escape but rarely most of the time while the computer boots it will also tell you what hot Keys get you into the BIOS when you've successfully spammed your F2 or delete button whilst your computer is booting you'll be met with this menu that truthfully looks a bit scary but do not worry although it looks scary it is almost impossible to do something that can harm your PC accidentally for me turning on a XMP is super easy as on the left hand side here it says XMP and then disabled all I have to do is click in where it says disabled change it to enabled then press F10 to save and exit for you turning on XMP might be done by changing your XMP profile to profile one instead of enabled you might also have to access advanced mode instead of easy mode like I had it on advanced mode is most of the time accessed by either pressing F7 double tapping f8 or tapping a once you find XMP and have saved and exited the BIOS your PC will Boot and your RAM will be set to full speed this will result in an incredible performance increase and the game will be much easier to play lastly a I do need to note that not every computer has the ability to enable XMP this is most of the time because of cheap motherboards cheap RAM sticks pre-built computers by Major Brands like HP Del Lenovo you name it or it is because you play on a laptop almost no laptops have the option to turn on XMP if you feel as though your game is spiking super hard after having turned on XMP it is because of the setting it's the only thing throughout this video that has the chance to do that for you so if that's the case follow the same procedure we talked about just seconds ago and disable it again it won't have any negative permanent effect on your computer circling back to a fortnite tip that will take your skill to the next level we have actively practicing scuffed difficult and uncomfortable edits in Creative you don't want to hop into creative to freebuild and you do the same triple edits builds and moves you done for the last year instead of doing that I want you to force yourself to do edits that you know you often fail at these edits can for example be wall edits where you're hugging the wall ster edits from difficult angles or something completely different doing these edits won't give you anywhere near the same satisfaction as doing your normal edits however it will give you tremendously more satisfaction long term thanks to the fact that you'll actually be improving compared to just playing brainlessly and freeb building like 99% of players do another great tip I actually personally got from one of fortnite's best coaches bleex is to play with low mats in ranked you see being able to finish fights quickly is essential if you ever want to become truly good if you're just playing to become good enough to impress your friends a little bit this tip is worthless for you but if you're playing to actually get earnings and make a little bit of a name for yourself playing with low mats forces you to be so incredibly smart in fights and also forces you to be confident because you know you have to make a play on your opponent SU sooner rather than later in a way this teaches you to fight in a totally different setting because you can't just bail out build 20 boxes and heal up because what often happens with players including myself is that I have 555 mats in ranked get in a fight I tag the opponent for 100 he tags me 400 we both box up and heal because we're both extremely stacked on mats and heals if you do this time and time again you only get good at playing when you have the perfect circumstances and let me tell you in tournaments this will not happen so how many mats should you play with you might ask BL X often told me just to do my normal farming and then when I left the spa I landed at I would have my mats to somewhere between 200 and 400 mats to no surprise to blood this simple little thing made me way better at finishing fights quickly and because of this I also started performing way better in tournament fights now next up I need to talk about something that I should have talked about way earlier in this video one of the best tips I can give to anyone when it comes to genuinely improving at any game really and that is getting in as many repetitions as possible when practicing and not caring about ranks wins or any stats this tip is super super important for a game like fortnite what a lot of people playing the game wanting to improve does is hopping into ranked and hiding in a bush for 20 minutes getting third place with zero elims and getting a ton of ranked progress this fake dopamine you get from your ranked progress is worthless for your actual Improvement as a player a player who W Keys absolutely everyone instead of playing for a rank in ranked will over time become exceptionally much better than someone who hides all game the same applies for if you're grinding out custom games if you're playing custom games to practice end games don't play those end games going for zero fights in the moving zones take fights in the moving zones figure out what works for you and what doesn't over time getting in repetitions of fighting and game fighting early mid and end game rotates every type of improvement comes down to doing it a lot or in simpler terms repetitions you know what repetitions don't yield any improvements in your skill hiding in a bush house or a trash can doing nothing so get those repetitions whatever it is you're playing whether it be creative ranked or Customs because trust me this is the way to become better than most the 15th tip is a very harsh one but one that made me better overnight in terms of getting better at fortnite and that is the tip of understanding that nobody cares about you or how you perform you see as a content creator before tournaments I would always have this voice inside of my head saying that I need to perform to be able to post good content to my viewers this quote unquote need to perform made me put so much more pressure on myself and let me tell you this this pressure did not at all make me play better it was actually so brutal to the point where I know for a fact it made me play drastically worse but then one day I drop a great friend of mine said you know that nobody cares right if you win the solo cash cup or get 11,000 Place nobody actually actually cares and when I heard him say that it was the most relieving thing ever because I knew he was speaking the truth nobody cared if I did bad which meant that there was no pressure I could play and do what I thought was best every game what ended up happening after hearing this was that I placed within the top 100 of the next solo cash cup I played which was my best solo cash cup placement ever at the time so next time you play a tournament just know that nobody cares if you do bad and nobody cares if you do good either which is a beautiful thing next up I want to talk about shooting back when you're low on HP for some reason most players who play at the beginner to intermediate plus level are super scared to shoot back when they're low on HP I'm talking some players that are within the top 1,000 on the pr leaderboards are even scared to shoot back when fighting a low Health understanding that when you're getting pressured by an opponent and you are on low HP that you need to shoot back is essential if you want to reach far in fortnite if I am the player pressuring you and I see that you're fixating on healing meaning that you're only thinking about popping your Shields and not shooting back at me I will have the easiest time in the world eliminating you so what I need you to do the next time you get low on HP in a fight is think the following do I have time to pop any heals at all or should I just be completely calm and go for a counter damage shot most of the time when your opponent gets you low especially if he's not the best he will make a mistake you can punish quite quickly that's why it's crucial that you actually punish it your first thought when it get tagged hard shouldn't be I need to heal I need to heal it should be that you need to relax your low on AG and you need to look at what your opponent is doing because you're not fighting against anyone else your opponent is the only one that can send you back to the lobby I also often see players getting tagged Down super low and when they're low they for some reason completely lose their awareness like if there's anytime you actually need full awareness it's when you're low so make sure you never ever lose track of your opponent when you're really low because every second you can't locate your opponent is a second you allow for him to heavily punish you in short when he get tagged maintain total awareness over your opponent's moves look for ways to instantly punish him by being calm don't fixate on popping Shields that one mini won't make a difference anyways when you deal counter damage which is often easier when the opponent is hyper aggressive make a decision should you reset the fight by healing and allowing your opponent to heal or should you switch your Tempo from playing hyper defensively to hyper aggressively so that you can send your opponent back to the lobby that is another skill you need to master in fortnite Tempo switching the skill of being able to go from playing defensively to aggressively in a split second on the topic of being the aggressive fighter in a fight I want to talk about what it takes to apply pressure effectively applying pressure becomes effective when you limit your opponent's opportunities to heal completely the best way to apply pressure is to maintain a total awareness over the opponent you're fighting and using both your weapon or weapons and your pickaxe where most people go wrong is losing awareness even just for a second over the opponent and now seeing that they're about to make an atat when you're the aggressor and you see that your enem is about to edit you have the advantage you can punish the edit with a pre-fire or even just take the trade if he's lower than you on HP you could also alternatively place a stair in his box if he's playing without a cone or stair already placed to force him to reposition to a new box that you'll get the opportunity to peace control I also need to say that so many people reload their guns at awful times in a fight reload management is crucial if you want to become a top tier fighter reload Management in simple terms is basically just reloading when you see that you're opponent has no time to heal most of the time this is when they're building new boxes reloading needs to be precise so the millisecond you see that the guy you're fighting is expanding is when you need to reload not when the box is fully built in order to master reload management you need to just actively think about it in a few creative rounds per day for a little B it really isn't that difficult to master but it's also something that doesn't come naturally to everyone so if this is the first time you're hearing about it make sure you implement it into the next time you're practicing talking about practicing the next St is arguably the best fighting tip I can possibly give out and that is W keing absolutely everyone in tournaments now tournaments are very much a benchmark of skill and a lot of you guys watching play them to get as good a placement as possible and that is totally understandable however if there is a tournament where you know you can't qualify make money or whatever then I highly recommend taking that tournament and just using it as fighting PRACK because trust me the amount of improvement you'll get from 3 hours of w King tournaments will be more effective than anything else you can possibly play I'd actually go as far as saying that 3 hours of WBY King tournaments is as good as 10 hours of finding good players in Creative even though you'll get way more reps by playing those rounds in Creative that's how insanely good practice it is to fight everybody and their grandmother in tournaments now the reason it's such a good PRACK is due to the fact that people are truly trying inys whereas in things like creative and ranked people often don't really focus or often just don't care all that much about going down meaning that we won't get anywhere near as good practice as in tournaments so the next time you see an event that doesn't matter all that much to you because you can't call for it make money or anything else in that category I challenge you to wkey everyone in it because trust me you will become a better player afterwards coming in as the 19th and final tip of today's video we have the fact that you absolutely must try to play Customs against the better and better players if you want to become really good I'm talking if you want to go pro this is a mentality you need custom games ask you guys know are matches where 100 players que up together with one goal in mind improving at tournament scenarios this means that the games are more stacked laggy and you have to be smarter to find success in them but unfortunately what happens to a lot of talents is that they start playing customs and they begin playing something like noble opens or monos scrims and they think that playing those Customs will get them to become tier one professional players getting into the grand finals of an fncs sadly that is totally wrong if you are someone who has a dream of making a good amount of money from tournaments or even going pro you should daily think about what you need to do to be able to play Customs against better players this is because the easiest way to go pro is by playing a lot of Customs against already professional players and balance that out with playing creative against some top tier Fighters too and you'll be a pro in no time most custom game Discord servers use a system where they host games for players within certain thresholds of the fortnite tracker PR leaderboards if you're top 1,000 you get to play against the best of the best if you're top top 2,000 you play against players from the top 2K to the top 1,000 and if you're outside of the top 2,000 in your region you play with everyone else that is outside of the top 2,000 meaning players who are totally new to competitive as well so in short think daily about what you need to do to meet the requirements to get into the best custom game Discord servers if you want to go pro this is the road to going pro in fortnite you won't get there without it

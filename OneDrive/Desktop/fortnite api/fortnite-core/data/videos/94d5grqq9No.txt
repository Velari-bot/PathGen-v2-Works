if you play fortnite competitively odds are you've heard of exit lag and today I'm going to put it to the test and since I'm in Canada which is around 5 hours away from the na Central servers I think I'm the best test subject so if it works for me it should work for all of you so really quickly this is my ping without exit lag you see I'm a Canadian boy with 90 ping at the very best I'm going to get 60 ping without exit lag on and that's why I downloaded exil lag using the link in my description and what I'm going to do in this video is test exil lag in the most popular modes like reload ranked and creative so you guys get the general idea of what exite can do to your ping also make sure you guys stay till the end so you guys can see all of the settings that I have on exela to boost my FPS but first I'm going to show you guys the main reason I don't use Gear Up booster and that is because Gear Up booster is almost double the price of exit lag in Canada it's $80 a year which is around 50 us and that makes it almost $40 cheaper than Gear Up booster all right moving on I'm going to test my creative since EIT lag boosts your creative ping the most as you can see in this clip right here I'm not using exit lag and you can see I average around 60 to 90 ping and then I just switch exit lag on while showing you guys just so you guys know I'm not lying and then look how much my ping goes down and now I am 25 ping every time you switch it on and switch it off in game it'll show a yellow X but as soon as the connection stabilizes you'll be fine since I know a lot of you guys guys care more about what the Ping is like in game I'm going to show you guys what it's like in reload now reload is the worst one by far it's not that bad I went from around 60 ping to 30 ping but it's definitely not as good as the other modes I honestly have no idea why this is if anyone can tell me in the comments why reload ping is so much more different because we will test ranked in a second here and you'll see that the difference is just like creative reload is basically the only one that barely gets affected from exit lag so I'm sorry for you reload players exit lag won't do that much but at the end of the day you can test it out yourself since it's different for everyone I'm going to show you guys more Clips in reload so you guys can see what my ping is like cuz it does end up getting lower in some points in fights [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] why bro really quickly before we get into ranked if you guys want to support the channel and enjoy the videos consider using Code wrath FN in the item shop I'd really appreciate that it helps a ton and yeah that's it so now I'm going to be hopping into ranked and I'm going to first show you guys what my ping is without having exit lag in ranked and it is the same ping I was showing you guys before about 60 to 90 even but then do end up turning on exit lag then I go back down to 25 ping it was feeling amazing I just love being this ping like every single time I see that ping go down it just feels amazing every single time I see that ping go down it just feels amazing and I was ready to fight I was ready to frag but then I end up getting pushed and I end up dying getting pooped on by one of my Subs cloudy oh no man and now I'm going to show you guys all of the settings that I have on exag that I got from petbot because he did used to use exit lag back when he wasn't in Dallas and these are all of the settings that he used all right so here are all the settings that you guys want to have on and off and I'm going to quickly explain what they all do so I have set maximum processing priority for games on because it sets the highest possible priority for the connected game what this means it it sets the game as the highest priority instead of other apps running in the background like your browser your files and other things so yeah pretty simple and then basically have the opposite for set minimum priority for other services so all of the other apps like Opera file explorer will be will be running at the lowest amount of priority I have disabled energy efficient ethernet on if you have really good Wi-Fi this can be a really good ping boost because it basically because your ethernet might be running on Energy Efficiency which you can also change in device settings but exit lag makes it easier and energy efficient just makes it less performance-based and will cause a little bit of performance performance cap disable game bar and DVR you should have on but the only reason I have it off is because I already have it because I already disabled it in the Windows settings so you can do that in the search tab just by searching up game bar but if you don't want to do all that you can just press here disable core parking so core parking is basically when your CPU just removes certain processes because they're taking too much energy and what disabling it does it makes it run all of those processes without caring about energy and unless you have a potato PC you should not be caring about energy and should be caring more about performance instead disable NTFS I have no idea what this does I'm not going to lie I have no idea what this does not going to lie you guys can read it though but Peter ball has it on so I have it on I'm going listen to the goat disable Windows performance counters so Windows performance counters is basically making your CPU not run at the highest it can because Windows thinks it's quote unquote unsafe I'm not sure that's kind of what I'm getting from this text right here so yeah turning this on will basically make your CPU run at the maximum it can and you know I'll take that any day disable SuperFetch is basically stopping windows from having background apps preloaded so then basically if you open up file explorer it's going to open up really quick cuz it's already running in the background like secretly kind of I guess that's what SuperFetch is and I disabled it because I'd rather just not have anything running in the background and I'd rather wait like two more seconds so uh disable Window search I guess is just to make your storage a little bit less packed and that can improve frames so yeah enable ultimate performance power plan just says right here just makes you get more performance than you already have and yeah that's basically all the settings the last thing I want to show you guys is general settings here at the gear it says start automatically with Windows you want to have this on because you want to have your exit lag start right as you turn on your PC so you don't have to like open it up wait for it to load and all that because you're always going to be using it if you really care about competitive and yeah right before the video ends I'm just going to give you guys the three big reasons why exit lag is better than gearup because I did do a video in the past and that video is pretty slow paced so if you guys did watch to the end I'm sure you guys care about this so listen up all right so first of all it's going to have to be the price $40 cheaper is a lot for anything that you're paying yearly or monthly that is going to end up being a lot so yeah the price is definitely better than gear up and that was my reasoning alone to get exit lag but the second reason is a big reason you need to get exit lag instead of gearup gearup honestly is terrible so many Pros have recommended it I did a video in the past and they only made my ping better about from about like 70 ping to maybe 6050 maybe at best 50 and that honestly I'm not willing to pay $40 more than exac and still get higher ping that just doesn't sound right to me and number three is going to just be the optimizations gearup offers almost next to zero optimizations for FPS and ping all it does is have the click on and click click off switch you can watch my video if you want proof but I'm not doing it in this video because I do not want to buy gear up again but yeah exit lag comes with a bunch of different optimizations and they all work for frames and ping there's more routes just B hold there's so much more benefits on exit lag and gear up just has none of that so yeah that is going to end the video for today guys I know it's a little bit of a different video but I haven't done a tech video in a while and if you are going to download and buy exit lag just make sure you use the link in the description because it does help me a lot I am affiliate on there this is not by any way a sponsored video I just really love exit lag it has made the game so much funner for me especially with where I live so yeah I love the people at Exit lag if you guys ever want to sponsor me I'm right here I'm waiting I can send you guys my email any day also I'm going to upload a pro analysis on poo very very soon since I am focusing on videos instead of streaming for a bit but yeah that's going to wrap it up for today guys peace

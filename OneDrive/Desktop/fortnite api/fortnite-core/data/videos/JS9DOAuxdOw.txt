I finally realized it after 6 plus years in the fortnite competitive Community I've came to the realization and conclusion that the main and most common reason for people failing to go pro is boredom and it's sad because it's such a simple issue with such a simple fix but to actually fix this issue you need to first of all realize that you actually have this issue which let me tell you you probably do but a completely just ignoring it so I'm going to use an imaginary scenario to hopefully help you relate so imagine an aspiring fortnite Pro called Bob recently Bob developed a routine after seeing one of my videos it goes as follows it starts with 2 hours of 1 V one realistics using a slow methodical play style trying really hard to win against the other player then scrims trying to write down notes and doing short V reviews on each game after each game and then finishing it off with 2 to 3 hours of solo ranks just King everyone he saw and just being a no C just completely locked in this is it Bob thinks to himself he's super motivated to grind out this routine and is really excited about that eventual drastic improvement he'll see months down the line of consistency so let's fast forward about 4 months and see what's up hm interesting Bob scen almost like no progress and what's that Bob's routine is almost completely different to when he started what in the world happened well it all went wrong about two weeks after he discovered and made his own routine for those first two weeks Bob had actually been pretty consistent with his new routine but it was at this point at the two we Mark where he started to get bored which led him to make changes bad changes he would start to sometimes just do one hour of ranked instead of three hours of ranked swapping it out for some other weird stuff like maybe jumping from different random creative maps to different random cre creative map and then maybe scrolling for YouTube or Tik Tok just a big mix of nothing really he would start to get off his PC earlier sometimes to just go watch Netflix or he would sometimes swap his 1 V one realistics with 1 V one zone Wars and maybe pgs where he would just completely use a play style he wouldn't use in tournaments like going really fast going for Clips basically just doing keeps of spamming and edit courses and whatnot basically straying away from that routine he originally set overall the theme for Bob is his boredom leading into laziness and I know if you're being honest bro that you would have realized by now that you can sometimes be like Bob too here's the reality you got to face with fortnite competitive a lot of the time the boring thing to do is usually the best thing to do just being consistent with playing hours and hours of on V ons ranked scrims with the proper place D every single day is the boring thing to do especially when you're doing it for months and months on end but but in this case you shouldn't change what you're doing just because it's getting boring because that's when you're going to start minimizing the effectiveness of your practice I'm sorry bro but if you want to go pro yes there will be a lot of times that you genuinely do have enjoyment but you need to prepare for boredom and make sure that every single time you make a change to your day-to-day practice it's not out of bordom and actually out of some logical thinking you need to accept and embrace bordedom because it will be an inevitable part of the journey to success and is usually a good sign that you actually are on the correct path to success just remember in terms of achieving great success like going pro in fortnite boredom isn't always a cause for change you need to think logically hey are you still stuck being a beginner to fortnite competitive because I created an ebook which talks about all the common mistakes I've seen beginners make and well obviously how to fix them too and the best part is bro I just decided to literally give it out for free so you might want to check it out bro click the link in the description

in this video I'm going to be explaining you guys how to get your first earnings in fortnite as all of you probably know I'm a six times fncs winner with over a million dollar earned from the game and I'm going to use my six years of fortnite competitive knowledge at the highest level to make sure every one of you watching reaches your first earnings to do this I made a post on my YouTube channel as well as a tweet asking you guys what questions you had about making your first earnings or just more earnings in general if you already have some of course and I'm going to be answering these questions throughout the entire video make sure to drop a like subscribe and let me know in the comments any other questions you guys might have about making your first earnings in fortnite let's get right into it than YT ask me how do you master a drop spot so mastering a drop spot can come down to a lot of things such as loot routes your timing your drop maps and things like that the best way to master a drop spot is to pick a drop that you're very familiar with to begin with um get a drop map and then after you get the drop map down make sure you practice it you know just Arena stupid tournaments stuff like that and then after you got the drop map part down and you picked where you want to land you want to go basically just you just want to loot it like just normally and then once you loot it you have a feeling for where all the chests are all that good stuff and then you want to make a loot route and then once you make a loot route you want to focus on the main things of timing when you can leave the POI where the most mats are stuff like that because your loot route want to be is optimized as possible for Speed and efficiency meaning basically you want to be able to farm mats as quick as possible leave the POI as quick as possible and go to your surch base as quick as possible and to do that you can go on fortnite.gg or you can even go in game and just look for the quickest loot out and then once you get all of that done another great way to master a drop spot is to 2v2 your friends or One V one if you're looking for a solo drop spot and that's just overall is going to give you the most experience quickly for your drop spot who did 1K ask me how much luck does it take to get your first earnings this is a very good question because luck does play a factor in your earnings and earning for the first time if you're playing the solo cash Cubs for example and you're going into end game and you felt like you played perfect you have three medkits four floppers splashes you have everything and you go to the heal off and you still lose because of one zone tick that you took earlier in the game but I would say for the most part luck isn't really a factor if you're good enough but to get your first earnings most of you guys are going to be going into heel off and things like that I would say 10% luck 15% luck out of 85 or 90 and the rest is mostly just skill because if you guys can properly manage your game and get into the end game with three medkits floppers splashes whatever it may be eventually you will earn Sams FN asked how do you rotate in a meta with no Mobility this is also a very very good question and uh a question that a lot of Pros might not even know um I kind of like to consider it not teaming but sort of a friendship kind of thing it's a it's a friendship meta so and what I mean by that I'm not talking about like trading surge or anything like that so when there's players next to you you have to know that you don't have to shoot them if they're rotating in front of you and they're not looking back of you and you also need to go that way and they eventually rotate but you don't rotate and you shoot them in their back all they're going to do is turn around and shoot you and stag your rotate so you got to just pick and choose your right rotates and when to shoot people in front of you specy ask me does practicing actually help and I think this is a very obvious question but I'm going to answer it anyways practicing does help but making sure you're practicing the right things and spending your time wisely is going to be more beneficial than just casually practicing you want to make sure that you're actually improving the things you need to improve if you're already a good box fighter maybe you should stay away from box fights for a little bit and practice something you lack in and that'll always is improve your game all around because if you find yourself practicing the same things over and over again you're not really going to see any Improvement but if your aim is bad but you're a good box fighter want to focus more on your aim bogor leaks asked is it worth pursuing fortnite as a future career fortnite is honestly a really solid career if you have the time and dedication to do it there's a lot of tools that fortnite gives you to you know grow like you have your YouTube your Twitch your Instagram Tik Tok ufn and competitive earnings it really just all comes down to how dedicated you are into making it a career obviously there is some times where it might not be worth it for some people given like age School Etc stuff like that but for the most part if you are you know dedicated and can do all those things it can pay off really well Lex asked me do you need specific items to earn this is a very 50-50 question because some items do help such as the siphon coin and the radar scanner but in reality no you don't don't need certain items to earn only thing you really do need which I guess is a certain item is like medkits floppers for endgame and the heal off and the solo Victory cup but other than that the medallions only increase your chances but you don't really technically need them my good friend Mike Scythe asked how do you go about improving your mechanics and Duo chemistry improving your mechanics will always come down just to the core practice and playtime but if you really truly want to grind and like practice the right things you know box fighting is always going to be up there one V oneing people realistics pgs anything like that or even there's a lot of turtle fight maps that help your quick reaction mechanics and such um as for duo chemistry the you know same thing it basically goes with like playtime and playing scrims together and playing the stupid tournaments together even hanging out with them outside of a fortnite setting is all very good ways to build a good Duo chemistry also not dropping your Duo if you find yourself consistently looking for new Duos obviously the chemistry is not going to instantly be there so it's always better to just sort of focus on practicing as much as you can but that doesn't mean you have to stick with someone if you guys are if your guys' placements are just not that good then it's probably not best to stick and look for something else cuz you can tell before dropping someone that it's just not going to work blow I will never lose asks me do you play better when you don't care I actually love this question because I can relate to this question very well I truly myself I truly play better when I don't care about the game and what I mean by don't care about the game I play as if there's there's nothing to lose because in reality there really is nothing to lose like for globals for example I played that whole globals acting like I didn't care like I was the best and I had nothing to lose cuz at the end of the day there's always going to be another solo cash cup Duo cash cup Grand finals you always have more chances but if you play like there's nothing on the line and just not care I find myself playing better but I know that doesn't really happen with other people sometimes you need to care more and what I mean by don't care like I'm not just sitting here hopping in random boxes and like throwing the game I mean I don't care about the tournament in terms of like oh if I do bad I do bad I'm just going to try my hardest kind of thing and another thing to go about like not caring I guess is not getting nervous I don't let myself get nervous for uh tournaments because you're just going to find yourself playing way worse Kevin asks what is the best way to improve your aim on controller the best way to improve your aim on controller is actually outside of the game it's mostly confidence um you don't want to ruin your confidence because you're just going to be overshooting over flicking not hitting the head y Yad yada you want to stick to like a very certain sensitivity or a range of sensitivities you don't want to go from playing 35 to 5050 just stay neutral stay in the area that you know and then your aim should improve at playet YT ask me what strategies or preparations helped you secure your first earnings in fortnite what strategies and preparations helped me secure my first earnings in tournaments um there wasn't really a lot of strategy or Preparation it was more so just like consistent game time and playing like all the solo cash clubs and stuff I eventually just earned for the first time but with the solo ccops now they're very simple to earn not a lot of strategy actually went into it but I can assume the more strategy and preparation you put in will probably reward you a lot better he also asked how did you balance improving your skills while also managing the pressure of making money um I don't really think either of those go hand inand I'd say that when you're first playing and trying to make your first earnings it's always better to just not really think about the money and actually just think about improving in general because eventually if you kind of like let go of the whole money aspect cuz in my eyes there's always going to be another solo cash cup there's is always going to be another Duo cash cup so if you just play to improve the earnings will eventually just come along with it we get to our final question Lucas asks what is the best game mode to get your first earnings and this a very easy one solo Victory cash cup the solo Victory cash cup is top 7500 to qual all you have to do is win a game and most of the games go on the med kits and a lot of people that win the games are actually not pros and really not that good so when it comes down to the end game you just get you know three medkits floppers that sort of thing and you have a really good chance of winning and it's probably going to be the easiest earnings you get besides maybe zero builds which is still a good chance but there's a lot of cheaters in that but solo Victory cup is definitely the best thing to get your first earning in

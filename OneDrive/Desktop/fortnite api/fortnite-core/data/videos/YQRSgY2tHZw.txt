ask any fortnite pro who the hardest player to fight is and nine times out of 10 they will say V know he lands at Grand Glacier and after getting an easy first elim he gets shot attempting to fight the boss now V know's immediate reaction here is to create some space to fight for but strangely he doesn't place a cone in any of these boxes now the opponent seeing this thinks he has an opening where he can slide a cone or a ramp into this box while he wall replaces so he starts spraying the wall however this is just a trap V knows that the other player is either going to swing his pickaxe or assault rifle the wall so as soon as the opponent gets close enough he places a cone straight away to ensure he doesn't get ramped over and then immediately does a top row edit catching the opponent off guard and hitting him for 56 damage now after resetting the wall it's weak so veto instinctively edits a cone to block any potential return fire from the opponent now that he has this HP Advantage he edits out the right hand side of his box and Sprint builds up some ramps to gain height and then the other players just decided to disengage so he's easily able to chase him down and wipe him out and most of ven's fighting style is made up of these very simple but effective mechanics later in this match voen has just captured his combat cach and he sees someone nearby he immediately switches to metal since he has extra in his box and it's the strongest material and then he Sprint ramps above the opponent to give himself the height Advantage from here he can see that the other player has left his back wall open so he drops down and attempts to place two cones to take this build piece from behind however this is unsuccessful as the other player has created a second box since the opponent has just placed this wall Veno tries to break through with his AR and grab the middle wall between the two boxes however he misses the timing and is left in a really awkward bad position under understanding that the opponent could just edit on him and hit him he jumps and edits the cone underneath him to block any shots he places a wall to his left before creating more space backwards now this wall here is very important remember it this makes the opponent think he's the opportunity to shoot so of course he edits the wall and attempt to shoot voo but he is as you can predict blocked by the cone so he resets now voo knowing the opponent's wall has freshly just been edited and reset and is now weak he goes over the top of the builds and drops down to the important wall that he placed earlier he does this carefully however placing a wall in front of him to block any edit from the opponent's box and a cone to stand on to ensure he doesn't get ramped over this blocking off of angles is a trend will see throughout most of his fights so he edits through the important wall and in this situation most people would try to replace the opponent's freshly reset weak wall however Veno does not do this instead he simply breaks it with one pickax swing and hits a 78 damage shot to give him the HP Advantage it seems like wall replacing would be better in this situation but sometimes when enemy's walls are so weak that you can break them in one pickaxe and it's clear that they're not paying attention I you can get some really easy opening damage this way now that he has the advantage Veno also doesn't just run into the box and try to finish the fight quickly as he could still die in through the entire game and since his fight will attract a lot of third parties with snipers he quickly boxes himself up to ensure he's safe before continuing to pressure the other player however this opponent tries to run away with a grapple blade so he does a slight little jump on top of the box to give himself the best sight Lin and hits an absolute bang of a snipe but this isn't the only way that Veno uses the snipe in fights he actually uses it to box fight Veno spots an En a boxed up using a big pot to heal so he knows that he already has the advantage in this fight now since there's 44 players up in the sixth Zone there's a ton of people who could third part of this fight so he actually creates two boxes on approach to ensure he doesn't get shot in the back Vino then uses the sniper to no scope the wall and in the same action places a wall behind him that he missed this knipe deals 110 structure damage meaning now he can break the wall in two pickaxe Wings instead of four however he fails to steal the wall however his muscle memory here is what's really important notice how before he goes to edit voo pulls out his shotgun this means that if he fails to steal a wall his attempt to edit it will instead fire the shotgun which will weaken the wall so that it can be replaced by a single pickaxe this means that with the sniper no scope and then the shotgun shot in combination he manages to do two wall replaces in around 2 and 1/2 seconds but apparently the opponent is German or French so he fails to steal it for a second time but this time rather than pressing his shotgun button before editing he switches to his assault rifle and does the exact same thing this time successfully this means that voo was able to get three wall rep attemps done in under 4 seconds while being fully protected with his Crosshair aim to the opponent in case they edit you may think this doesn't sound very impressive but watch this from the opponent's perspective he then manages to get a ton of damage by just spraying so since the opponent is blocked off this angle with a bunch of ramps he moves around to the side and switches up the angle that he's attacking it again ensuring he's completely protected however at this point he sees the opponent attempt to run and this has not gone well for any of the other players so far so V does something that's incredibly simple but that most players are yet to have in their muscle memory a Sprint jump now since jumping out of a box on a cone is a very precise action that requires you to stand almost completely in the top of the cone that's inside of your box and have some forward momentum you can actually just do a small Sprint jump which increases the height of your Jump by around a quarter of a tile since you can also edit while sprinting V can Sprint jump and edit the top of the box to get outside of it and then build a ramp to land on to quickly Elevate himself up to tiles which allows him to finish off the running player now if you want to practice any of these mechanics I've just released my first ufn map called the 1v1 practice Hub which has specific wall replacing and peace control scenarios you can practice against other players or you can just do classic build fights Bo fights realistic Zone Wars clutch fights aim jewels and zero bu practice or any combination of these through our unique voting system you can use the code that's on screen or search One V one prank sub or resub to find it and I'm following back some people on Twitter who favorite the map so let me know how you like it and if there's anything I can prove on it one thing you may notice is that voo always carries the flury Fizz instead of the grapple blade this not only allows him to carry two heals and Mobility but it frees up an inventory slot for a sniper during this cash cup I'm pretty sure his accuracy the sniper was like over 80% please don't fact check that though but that's not the only reason the flber fiz is worth carrying venu starts his fight by sliding two cones into an opponent's box from beneath before going for the wall replace where he's able to open the fight with a 73 damage shot he just a bit of an awkward Peak after this to hit another 28 Dam damage shot but it's chunked back in return and now has to heal since the opponent is distant himself Veno takes this time to pop a few ticks of the Fizz now when you jump and slide with the flowury effect your movement speed is increased most people just use this to rotate however here as Veno is falling he no scopes the wall and then slides with his pickaxe out in an attempt to swing through the wall and get into the opponent's box unfortunately this was a metal wall and it was a little bit too strong to go through in this one phase but after finishing up this fight he does this later in the game now in the end game he cracks a player who's flying through the sky using a grapple blade and this bler boxes up on low ground he places two cones and slides on them while timing his two burst shots to break through the wall and slide straight into the box picking up an easy elim if you're the opponent in this situation this is incredibly difficult to counter because you have almost zero time to react but you also don't necessarily need the flowury effect as Veno didn't do it on that 10th elim and he didn't do it on this sixth elim in the game either however the flber F makes it much easier because you'll be moving faster which you have a much higher likelihood of actually going through the wall plus you can do this from higher and you won't take fall damage now most of these players are relatively good however in some early games you will face some not so great players and voo uses a few ways to bait these players to pick up absolutely free elim in this game he lands at Snooty steps and after clearing out a few players of Spawn and grabbing the Mythic Hammer Pump and The Medallion he drops down to the Vault now it's really common for players to push here for the additional loot so he blocks off every exit as you always should and he hears some footsteps of a player sneaking around him this is where he makes the the big brain play of just shooting the floor the opponent thinking there's a fight down here starts to break through the builds and of course is met by a big pump shot and this isn't the only funny bait he uses either later in the match V notices a player boxed up in a 2X two x two box on the combat cache now I don't know about you but this smells of a player who does not want to fight and probably is not that good uh editing re here I checked this guy follows me on Twitter I'm sorry seeing this Veno immediately ramps onto height and pulls out his cone to see if the opponent is sitting in one of these cones after know if there's a player holding edit inside a cone then there'll be a lock symbol on your Crosshair and you can easily identify where they are but after not finding him in there he drops down to a sidewall and starts swinging he opens this with a nice 40 tag to get some damage onto the other player and given the obvious visuals he feels safe enough just to jump straight into the box and end the fight quickly both players drop down onto the lower layer and the opponent is positioned right up against his wall in this corner now this is a tail sign that he's going to do a peanut butter edit Peak and go for a shot so Veno just moves towards the wall on his left this block part of his body from the opponent's view giving him a much better right hand Peak if he actually moves around halfway back into the box he'll be completely hidden from the opponent's perspective and he'll actually still be able to see them from here he just repeatedly tries to bait the opponent into an edit knowing he has the better Peak and the HP Advantage he just keeps taking out his pickaxe fake swinging and canceling it by switching back to his shotgun and he does this three times until the other player eventually just edits on him and he's able to out trade him from the better angle hopefully some of these fighting tips were helpful and don't forget to check out the 1v1 practice hub

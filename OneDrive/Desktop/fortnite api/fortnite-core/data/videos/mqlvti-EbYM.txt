40 20 cracked and 100 i got gold pump and purple smg i am ready let me get my fragrance to the position he needs diving and i talked about it and probably if you watch jivin's video about how he's becoming a fragger now you understood the story but for the people who missed it long story short jive and i have been dueling for a while now and the way he was describing it to me he thinks that he gets a little too caught up on some rotate sometimes and just some small minor things and he thought that it would be a good idea if he tries out how to be a fragger not only will it both help us learn the game a little more but i think this role switch could be good because i kind of feel like i'm more so meant to be an igl rather than a frag and it kind of makes a little bit more sense because jivin has some cleaner mech he's also a really good fighter in certain situations and he pops off a lot in the solo cash cup so why not throw him in the fragger position and see how he does also i was playing with jerian's duo on west one time when jivin couldn't play and we managed to get like two wins a second place and a third place so needless to say i think i have what it takes to become a pretty good igl and at the same time it's not like we're gonna just forget everything jivin's still gonna help me out through these mini games and through the off spawn and stuff like that because at this point in time when it comes to fortnite duo cash cups the best duo are both igls and fraggers when you can both fill those same roles in different situations that's when you're gonna shine as a duo because you guys understand how the game is played on different levels so yeah this video kind of a long intro i'm sorry this is the duo cash cup and this is the first time i ever igled it with jivin i'm kinda getting back into the roll a little bit it was tons of fun and actually we had some really good pop-off games and we placed probably this is like our second best placement ever and this is only the first time i ever i jailed an event before i'm gonna walk you through a little bit what's going through my head in certain situations but also show you the gameplay and the story as we go along a lot of times in these cash cups we have an insanely hard time getting a good wp game and that's what we struggled with this week first game we got a 16th place the next game we got 31st the third game was practically so dead so i'm barely gonna show this we got a fifth place with seven kills moving on to game number four this is where we managed to take hype but it was really shambles because we were really high up and i almost take full responsibility because as the igl i should have been leading this tarp a little more and trying to get ahead before the zone actually started moving and it messed this up because we got sprayed the entire time but we got a ninth place out of it not too bad so let me know i'm gonna include this in the video because it was a god-tier solo clutch in my opinion i end up picking up a decent amount of kills but in this specific scenario i kind of approached going about this rotate in a little bit of the wrong way and that's kind of because this is brand new to me with this igl stuff personally i think that jiving was a little too far behind me during this rotate because it looked free to me when i was doing it i think that if he was a little bit closer maybe i should tell him about it or comment more so that way he's more on the same page he wouldn't have been behind and got jumped but at the same time jivin pointed out to me that going down the center of the zone which makes tons of sense there's gonna be people with angles all around us and the people who are on back edge they're gonna be trying to rotate in and they're gonna run directly into our pack so i kind of see jivin's point too and i agree with it but at the same time i think being a little closer could have helped us a little bit more here nevertheless because of my rotates jivin ends up going down so that's on me but at the same time i managed to come out on top with a god tier solo clutch in this game i feel that because i've learned so much about how to play as a solo and then the solo catch cups i had siege coaching me which ways to rotate and all this stuff with jive and reviewing my games i got a deeper understanding of how to play this game in duo cash cup scenarios which allowed me to pop off so well here check it out you're in or 800 thousand nice it's all good we like to sprint that left side hold that angle on your back two duos uh two other solos this game was one of the best games that i feel like personally as an igl i'm extremely proud of you you're gonna notice throughout this game how i was kind of leading tarps leading the rotates trying to pick the right side of zone so i can get my fragger to the end game gonna let this game play a little bit if i see anything worth mentioning for igls i'm gonna point it out crackdown dirty what he's going to edit on you that's stay active here team to the left i'm going to cut up right over there cut up yep i'm building i'm building just wait for someone else to get pride i just fried the high team grappling follow follow follow follow fall grapple grapple again nevermind oh i hit it again it's fine we're in here follow me follow me right now i would say the most important thing is notice how i'm picking aside during these end games and i'm getting up and gaining elevation after i land this makes the next rotate easier because one run the dead side and two we're not on shambles logo we're almost in i'm just gonna tarp the rest do it pulls max okay here i'm tarping it i'm tarping it i'm grappling ahead i'm grappling ahead okay all right i have a baby

you're second place let's go bro good game nice bro zaifa if you see this you're going down buddy every time we land here usually when we get in the high elo zyph is always here and we die this is one of the games that we really needed to pop off a little more but at the same time this game wasn't too bad from an igl perspective we just couldn't find any refreshes along these zones that i was rotating and maybe because of me being a newer igl i kind of put us in good spots to survive that doesn't necessarily mean that i was putting us in good spots to get refreshes and maybe that could be the difference to why we didn't do as well as we thought we were going to do in this game i'm going to grapple off this tree i'm getting in front i got splashes okay ready going use two grapples stay elevated a little bit going off this wood try and look for a refresh if we got anything i'm with you maybe a drop down i'm not coming okay yeah i'm with you i'm farming this brick i have zero meds i

stay with me we're gonna grapple here take a little bit of mats all right okay i've 120 bills here grappling right now okay okay getting above this wood i'm here i need to pop big okay is that our metal yes bottoms go this side i mean oh i have no bills after all these games you've seen so far we're placed 78th on the leaderboard right now with and 112 points not too bad so in this game this is kind of funny story we managed to run into the same game as cold and scented their tier one pros definitely they're insanely cracked at this game and we saw them when we landed at our spot we saw them in the kill feed and we heard fighting back mansion which was like behind where we landed so we thought through this game that we were just gonna rotate early we're gonna get like dead center zone and there's no way that we get keyed by them and what do you know the only players that run up on us are cold and scented this is how that fight went down same right 180 all right i gotta hit 80. i'm big they're up top of me i think it's two teams now are they on you no i'm just yeah i'm getting pressured by a third party i'm safe i'm safe okay i have a tarp up here yep we're next to each other we're good i got dropped down i'm coming back up i'm dead 70 one i think i just need to die right so believe it or not after all that adversity we end up getting in a really really stacked game i die off spawn and jivin reboots all the way on the back edge of zone and we end up getting keyed by mars ow after that fight jivin put some work in we fly over the bugle we get shot up like crazy and we somehow find our way into the zone we reduce our mads and we're looking good going into this final game and it's still possible to crawl on this all we need to do is get the win me personally as the igl i'm thinking okay i need to get my teammate as deep into the zone with me as possible so that way we have a solid chance at pulling the next zone we end up pulling almost every single zone and this is where after all this stuff that just happened i made a crucial mistake to leave a side open as i was running down this tarp i think i got a little flustered and confused about where the enemy was when i landed for some reason i thought that they were just not gonna chase us if i just continued to run away from them in this moving zone i should have blocked off my sides used my mats if i decided to tarp in the center of the zone that was just dumb but overall i feel like the first time i ever igles we got a 136th place and after all those mistakes jiving in the last cash clip of the season almost clutched up qual through all that trash stuff that happened i think this roll switch is gonna work out for us perfectly and i'm definitely excited to see our placements improving over this season just to give you guys perspective on this duo i'm looking at fortnite tracker jivin and i had a 136th place 122nd place and a 74th place those are our best placements ever in a duo cash cup and you could see literally see the progress that we're making and it's really close to qual on some of these cash cups we've been improving like crazy and i almost feel like we don't even realize it drop a like if you enjoyed this video and i'll see you in the next one peace

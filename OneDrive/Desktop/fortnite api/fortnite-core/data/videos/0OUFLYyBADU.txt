what's up guys we here so i've never really made a video on like a tutorial of how to piece control but that's what we're going to be doing today i'm just going to be walking through you guys like the basics and like how to piece control and what i really do what i'm fighting in the game and how i really use peace control to my advantage so i hope you guys enjoy uh should be it should be a pretty nice video it should be really fun and very educational for you guys to go through and just kind of like inside the mind every video you know how peace control and stuff like that so if you guys have a good time make sure you hit the subscribe button like the video comment all right this is [Music] wow oh my god [Music] so what peace control really is is like basically getting bills around your opponent just like placing the builds before your opponent and predicting where your opponent is going to be is so you can have bills waiting for them so really what peace control comes down to is mainly prediction so you have a guy boxed up right he's boxed up the main thing if he's troll is like where he's gonna go try to build like accordingly it's like the direction you think the guy's gonna go these controls like mainly like getting bills around where the player is going to end up being so then you have full pc control and like builds around that player to like so you could take a fight with them all right suppose sorry to start off number one in this scenario just go through sorry wall the guys honestly right here so in this situation he's gonna stay at the side angle like you can stand as far back as you want you just gotta like it's really easy to get to completely so you can place guns really far away so you do that and then instantly you'd want to take this wall just so like because a lot of the times people try to go for the backlogs first but if you do that and you're too slow with it the guy this guy could just take this wall so first what you're going to do you want to take this wall full box in like that and then hit a little thing like this a little window deep speak around the back we started here we can put you place the cone brace though so you go to here place the cone wall we have that we can make a window a lot of the time with this little right-hand window peak you're just not gonna get shot especially with the charge about instead of bumps if you could do this and you have a charge and you could start your charge like earlier then you get a peak you should have a max charge and then 130 to the body or you can also do this peak and then you got it back behind it but a lot of times if you do this you're going to want to place a cone because then this guy's gonna be there's like this here and you do that you can just run over place just there and then it's just over for you so if you wanna do that you wanna make sure you do this put it going down first and then that works out just as well so next off we're going to be on number six you come up here the guys under your box so say you have a guy full box right in this situation you want to edit out whatever here on full box tray if you have all the walls around them edit out place the cone and just hit a little right hand peek like this a lot of you guys know there's a quick speak you full block that out to the right see the little side peak like this another really good thing to do too is if they're like they're a good player they're gonna like run at this corner so if they're doing that and this is your stair and everything you can do edit this and just edit one tile of the stair and then you have a free shot on them but obviously you can't do this wrap so you just full box go over here place the cone pretty easy go all right nothing if you want to get fancy with it you run up full box them please cone for it like this do this side up and this this is this will really help you like float your mechanics like just to get better at double edges it's there it also looks really cool if you going for clips or anything for like highlights like these type of clips are really nice number seven boys they're one layer above you it's their floor above you all you want to do is slide jump place the cone or wall get this around them you get an easy shot off just aside same thing every time just do that and another thing also if there's a wall already here oh we obviously can't do it on this because there's this but even if there's a wall here what you usually do if you look up above like the wall like towards like the top part of the wall the cone places over their head so say like another thing you could do when you slide them you place the wall first and then they come above them so then you have a full piece feature like that and it's much safer and then you just edit this and there's already a count up there in this full box and you have it pretty easy to go all right boys this is number 10 i believe so there's a guy here we take the wall classic kill him and then out here you place the cone first and make a full box and do it the first part manga classic is really easy then with the second part when the guy is dropping down what you want to do you want to place both cones first so there's no way he could place a stair and he can't get out and see it's one of these sidewalls and they go to player usually if they'll get the gun first and sidewall and jump sidewalls jump out like this and do a side jump but if they're not like not the best player in the road you know it's usually gonna be the case in like your random matches and whatnot you place both these guns here then you get the wall make a dorito edit try to like duck behind this when placing if you look up you could usually get these two walls and then you just hit a little dorito peak box side edit and you should get the elimination all right so nice for the code to number 11 we just have the guy here dude in these situations if you look up really high you could throw a high wall is what most people call them you do a high wall there's like a little edit like this top right dorito at it you get the walls around them the only wall they have to the left is there and you should have a little great at it you usually place the cone first or another thing you can do you can place guns from really far away and a lot of another people a lot of people don't really know about you place like cones from pretty much anywhere as much distance as you want so you do like that you put them in the cone you start back here you run up place two cones look up get the high wall then you have full piece control this box the only way you can get out is by running out and by then you could run up here to make the lid added on amina all right come out to number 12 boys this is where like you're above them this is really good in scrims and tournaments and stuff like that and stock engines when people are like a box bully you have double units like this you go for a wall get the wall make a long wall and call it like that it's really good you just oh it's pretty simple self-explanatory you take the wall you have double just like this so you can't count on anything take the wall you right at it let's get a punch shot in it's just really good to practice more fluent reflection your peace control stuff like that just helps you get fluid with everything nothing really too special just really practice all right so we're on number 13 i think it is right here it's when you're dropping down kind of like changing layers in engine like when you're mid-engine like this is really helpful like when you're changing players from say on the second height like a midi on there you drop down just like as low as far as you can you can do this to cut off the tarp so say this guy's right here coming from here he's doing a sideways type like this what you could do you jump down look as low as you can get the wall and then he has like a stair like this right because he's doing this you hit a little full box and there's a stair already like this and you just have a pretty easy pick free free refreshing game all right run number 14 here boys just run through do whatever you really want here like it says all the models hey you have a guy full box or not a full box like just all his walls right it's inside of here you can go for the top just do whatever you really want really just practice box heading kit this is really good if you're hard zero ping i'm just taking walls you know let's practice some longer classic stuff like that and also another thing that's really helpful when you're taking walls say you're right here right you're swinging at a wall when you take the wall put it in a cone and then your wall like say if they're looking the other way like what when you take the wall it's like this wall here right take the wall but you put the cone then the wall so then you have a cone in their box full pieces control the box they can't build the stair anything they walk while i'm off they're gonna end up having to try to edit out one of these sides but by then you'll have a free like 90 damage shot maybe like 140 if you had a headshot you know or if they're like not the best player they've missed their edit a few times whenever you have a free elimination all right number 15 the last one all right and this one there's the guy here you come up on the stair take the wall get the cone in pretty simple another really good friend game taking worlds from different angles making a big edit putting a conan free refresh for the team hey a lot of you guys probably wonder what my favorite move is when peace controlling somebody this one's pretty cool walk up go for the wall right you swing at the wall try to take it he hit it's out this way you're just full box you're right and then he's just done for him see we can start for example without a person they have a box right here i go up start swinging at their wall you get their one shot they edit out you put two cones in here and then the wall and then they run into there they're not going to be expecting it then you just edit the wall throw two walls or they're probably their walls yourself when they panic then you just have a free pump shot on them show you one more time in action so he goes up there i come up i swing at his wall once we pre-placed the cones to the right and i just have the full box and it's just done for nothing you could do all right another one of my favorite moves is when i'm going up i throw a high wall like this like when you go up to a high wall edit a window at the top and place the cone through it so say like somebody's up here they're ramping up i'm down below them i'm coming up too i get this wall right here that i please i edit the window throw a cone jump to the side get this wall full box and you get it easy pump shot so players like to ramp up so it's going up i get the wall right here i place the cone if it wants to do this i come to the side and i just get a free pump shot now so if the light is from the top and that's just a free elimination we have some new ones and then so oh my god [Music] [Laughter] oh no you're so bad [Laughter] no no no no no right here make it double edit stare back get the floor get the wall and then he's just full box i go up right here i added the stair right here and get the wall to at the wall place the voice so he can't put me off get the wall put two walls behind him with my shot but uh just took everything before he could really i had to stay here i thought get the floor get the wall get the two walls behind him with my pump shot and just switch it to death here's a clip from a silver cash cap i believe okay it doesn't be pretty weak i'm going to wait till i feel with pumps right there this is my wall first try that's their thing obviously [Music] right away make a full box up here he goes he's one box away from me hey that would place the wall so basically what i did i saw he was one box away from me so like he is based up right here so what you can do in this situation you edit out right here get that wall before he can do anything while he's swinging on my wall he has no control like this there getting out the only way he can get out as if he had runs to the side but by then i'll have a free shot off on him and i just hit the pawn shop so yeah place the little window crouch put both of the cones one on the bottom one on the top so you can't get out anywhere pretty free pump shot to the shop the wall uh we're just gonna be walking through some uh some of my pretty good recent dips just pretty simple peace control clips try to teach you guys a little bit about peace control so in this clip my name is i go through there's the long block right so there's no belts like open among the box and here we'll get all the cones and walls down in this like little area before he can because basically what this is it's like a box type right here it's there's no way he could get out there's no stairs he could place what i make this into i turn it into a 50 and so it's just an aim bottle and obviously i'm really confident my aim is almost the time i'm going to win this basically i just edit through placement at another wall of basic cone then so the i fully controlled everything he has no control of any builds in any of the boxes and he's just forced to take aims with me and i usually win a lot of those and i have the right hand as well basically pretty simple right after that i'm just gonna kill that guy this guy right in front of me i he just doesn't know which direction he's looking basically all i really did here i get double edits above him to stay in the floor he's trying to run out i make a quick edit like you can't get out of here then i get the cone down in both walls so there's the weekend around these horses right this one another zone is actually really good at packaging mechanics and stuff so right here is one box in front of me they get it like this right there make edit full box um phone on the wall from the side he's gonna keep him drinking that way but then i just go around a little reverse on him he ends up dinosaur after him for 150. so right here what i did i wait for him to like walk out into my box i full box him and then he's going to the left and storm i get the boat guns like i'm going to talk about later in the video it's both stones doing the wall and then so i get both cones the wall right there i'm going to go from the other side to the right side and then as you see right here i get all the walls except for the left wall so he runs out that way then i get both cones and then the left wall but he expects me to make edit on the football play go back to the right beat him out max damage charge shot and then still before him all right so this is the keyboard clip mouse and keyboard i just played a lot of wages amongst the keyboard just for fun keep the game new and just starting to keep where to play in the game pretty much this kid right here i go up uh i do a slide jump high wall with the wall above i don't get the high wall right here but then to the side i make the box out two tones and run into the card spot and then full block what i do right here jump out it's a little high wall right here look up i don't think this high wall so i jump out again and then i place the wall and if it's top right it gets pouring down you can't do anything come on go ahead and walk through the walls of course get back here just gotta run through man all right guys hope you enjoyed that was pretty cool video really fun to film i was just like getting it just down i've like had a piece of trouble stuff like that and i hope you guys enjoyed make sure you turn on the nerdies deadpool stay tuned for more vids on extra gaming [Music] you

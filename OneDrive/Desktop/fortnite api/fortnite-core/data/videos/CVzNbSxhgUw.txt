aiming is something I've always been incredibly interested in and in today's video I'm going to be going over how you can get insane aim in fortnite I'll be going over everything from the fundamentals the secrets by mastering aiming and how to practice your aim to develop it to an incredibly high level over the next few weeks with that said let's get into today's video before I talk about anything else I need you all to understand how the hitboxes work in fortnite this is how the hip box looks when using the shotgun our goal is always to hit the head hip box and deal as much damage as possible unless of course you know that the opponent you're fighting is one shot even in the body or legs when aiming at an opponent with a shotgun you will always aim at the nose the most pointy part of the nose of any fortnite character is the complete middle of the head hip box what this means is that when you fire your shotgun at Theos you give yourself the best odds of hitting as many pellets as possible on the opponent and therefore dealing the most amount of damage possible when it comes to to spring with ARs on long range you want to aim at the middle of the chest in fortnite weapons without Scopes have a lot of balloon this means that the bullets land randomly within your Crosshair so even if you track an opponent 100% perfectly you can miss a few bullets because of the bloom aspect and this especially applies for people who aim only at the head when spraying on medium to long distances so that is why when going for beams on any distance you must always aim at the chest to give yourself the best odds of Landing as many shots as possible and dealing as much damage as possible when it comes to spraying with weapons like SMGs and ARS when you're really close to an opponent or in their box you want to also exclusively aim at the middle of the chest the same rules apply here since the Bloom on hip firing is so significant that even if you have the best aim in the world and track the opponent's head you'd still be better off just aiming at the chest in addition because of a bloom some bullets will be head shot although your cross or is at the opponent's chest now that you've understood just how important understanding the hit box is the next thing I want to talk about is downloading the program H for better fps and less input delay since this will make aiming in game a ton easier to download home simply go to the description below click the first link and hit the download button then when it's downloaded go through the installation process then you'll have to sign in through your browser this is simply done by clicking sign in through Google or Discord if you don't already have an account make one and you'll be good to go when the program opens up you'll see a long list of optimizations they also have detailed descriptions under each and every one so you know exactly what you're doing when turning one on for example here you can see they have an option to turn on gaming optimizations and slightly high up they have a setting called disable windows power throttling that is a setting that is absolutely crucial to have disabled if you're playing on a laptop in addition to this they have game specific tweaks so if I head to the left hand side here and go down to game optimizations and click in on fortnite I can activate horn performance which will optimize my PC for Optimal Performance if anyone of the tweaks don't feel worth it to you then you're just one click away from disabling them when I use my FPS not only increases by about 30% but the performance is also more consistent which makes play tournaments customs and of course creative a lot easier and the beauty of it all is that it is free to use but with a slight caveat of only 10 optimizations with premium you get unlimited optimizations and no ads check it out in the description below or the pinned comment next up something I wish somebody had told me sooner is that in order to have good aim in this game you absolutely need to have full awareness of the player you're fighting and what I mean here is that when you make an edit on an enemy you want to look at the opponent and not the wall you're editing in addition you also want to make sure that throughout a fight you don't lose track of the opponent not even for a second by having a full awareness over the player you're fighting you'll be ready to take any opportunity he gives you to shoot at him and if you don't have fill awareness you might miss out on multiple chances to deal some serious damage to him now when a lot of people make an edit they look at the edit instead of the opponent like I talked about just a second ago but this is something that makes aiming much more difficult since you'll have to look at the wall then quickly change your focus to where the opponent is then find out what kind of mouse or controller movement you have to make to shoot them so every time the next time you practice make sure that you can consistently perform edits without having to look at the wall or edit menu exclusively look at the opponent and trust me your aim will already be way more consistent if you can't have good mechanics without having to look at your builds and edits you have a lot of work to do mechanically and for a lot of people this is quite easy to improve as long as you're a wear ofan which is a great thing another extremely important thing I never see anyone mention is how your movement heavily impacts your aim the first thing I need to talk about here is how you get a lot more Bloom when walking forwards and spraying compared to walking both backwards and sideways this applies when hip firing and adsing so in mid to long range situations it is absolutely crucial not to W when spraying with your weapons for example when taking a bloom battle however when you're in boxes pressing W and getting close to the opponent will often be a better play thanks to how you can have more of the opponent inside of your Crosshair compared to if you spray from further away so when taking Bloom battles stay away from holding W completely Press Your A and D buttons to strafe back and forth and be unpredictable or if you see an opportunity to stand still whilst being crouched that will give you half the bloom that's strafing back and forth will and three times less Bloom than holding W but of course this will make you a much easier Target to it so be careful with taking the sitting completely still approach the worst thing you can do to give yourself a terrible Bloom is jumping so when fighting off spawn for example and you get an SMG stay away from jumping as jumping will limit your chance of succeeding heavily when it comes to eliminating the opponent you're fighting strafe back and forth with a and d and stay on the ground and do not at all press W this is really really important and unfortunately I see a lot of players who strafe perfectly back in fourth but sadly have the bad habit of also holding W whil strafing please please stop doing this and your tracking will become much better instantly so in short all you need to remember is exclusively use a andd don't jump jump and don't press W this will limit the Bloom as much as possible whilst you're still being a hard target to hit something else that is extremely interesting is the pellet spread on shotguns and again this is something nobody talks about even though understanding it plays a massive role when it comes to mastering aiming in fortnite when you shoot a shotgun shot your gun will shoot out a number of pellets The Sentinel pump for example shoots out 12 pets so the question is how can I give myself the best odds of all pellets hitting my opponent and dealing as much damage as humanly possible the easiest thing that makes pellets more likely to hit is being close to the opponent when watching pros play you'll often see how they consistently win trade situations because the opponent they're fighting is far away when he shoots and them the pro is close when shooting this is an ideal way of playing in trade situations but let's talk about how to hit heavy shots when slightly further away crouching heavily limits the pallet spread so even if you are far away from an opponent crouching down and lining up a shot can result in super heavy damage output that is also why you'll often see Pros quickly crouching down as soon as they're about to fire their shotgun to onto that adsing or aiming in with a shy reduces the pellet spread tremendously so sometimes taking a extra time to aim in and shoot a shot is worth it because most of the time you'll do significantly more damage when doing this compared to hip firing your shotgun so that is also something to consider the way to limit pellet spread the most is by crouching an ad guessing at the same time although you'll rarely find an opportunity to do both at the same time in real games moving on you need to know that the pellet spread is without a Shad of Doubt worst when you jump even though the Crosshair is the same size When jumping and when holding W so if you have a habit of jumping around in boxes and shooting I would highly recommend learning to change your muscle memory to shooting when you're on the ground firing your shotgun when in the air will add a layer of RNG to your game you can't have if you want to become someone truly spectacular so keep that in mind the next time you hop on of course when doing right hand Peaks you will at times have to jump but this trade-off is worth it because you're taking a protected shot on the enemy lastly I want to quickly talk about one player who understands pellet spread better than anyone else and that is cold if you ever watch a Cold Stream tournament video or highlight you'll often see him moving super fast doing incredibly impressive sets of builds and edits and then right when he fires his shotgun he stands still for just a second this is to give himself the best odds possible of all 12 pellets hitting the opponent he knows that if he presses W on his keyboard or jumps the pellet spread will be way wider compared to if he stands still interestingly you'll also get less pellet spread when pressing S A and D compared to holding W so that is also something to keep in mind but the difference is quite minimal of course you can stand still for long when fighting and shooting so it's essential that you're able to time your shot with standing still crouching or adsing perfectly you want to try to stand still for as short a time as possible possible in addition to this I need to add on that you obviously don't always want to stand still when shooting most times in fortnite you need to be moving to make yourself difficult to hit for the opponent but for example when peace controlling someone from above doing a window edit on an opponent or when your enemy has just fired a shot standing still is something you shouldn't be scared of because if you're able to implement it effectively into your way of playing you'll hit way more max damage pumps all right now that you've understood the fundamentals of aiming it's time for me to talk about what you can do today to improve your aim and the first thing I'm going to teach you is how you can get prle Crosser placement with nothing more than a few minutes of practice every day having good Crosser placement in most games usually means naturally holding your crossair at head level so that you only have to horizontally adjust to hit for example a Max damage pump on the opponent however because fortnite has building and editing it's a little bit different in this game in order to become a pro player or anywhere close to it you need to master Crosser placement to some extent and this is exactly how hop into a map that has an AI freebuild section I prefer this one but you can use whatever map you like then you want to start freebuild and fighting the Bots like you would fight a normal opponent and exactly when you confirm an edit and the opponent is on the other side of your edit you want to stop look intensely at the Crosshair and think where did my Crosshair naturally end up after I confirmed my edit now after confirming your goal is to have your Crosshair in a spa where it's easy for you to adjust onto the opponent it doesn't have to be directly on the enemy right after confirming as that's nearly impossible but it's crucial that your Crosshair is somewhere where you can make a simple adjustment to hit a heavy shot if your Crosshair ends up in a spot far away that requires you to flick hard onto the opponent it's not weird that your aim is inconsistent so very simply put it hop into a creative map that has an AI freeb building section start building and fighting the Bots and then perform edits on the Bots and stop after having made an edit look intensely at where your Crosshair ended up and ask yourself is this an easy adjustment to make to hit a Max damage pump when you've answered that question make the mouse or controller movement needed to eliminate the bot well still looking at the Crosshair and go again after you've done this a few times start playing faster build and edit on the Bots and then when you have a shot continue to look at your Crosshair and make the adjustments do this for 25 minutes a day and I promise you your crossair placement and aim will get one step closer to Pro level now that you've understood the basic principles of Crosser placement and how to practice it I want to teach you the max pump aim method this aim method right here is used by Pros all around the world and is one of the most powerful ways of consistently improving your aim over time and as soon as you learn it you'll almost instantly become a much better aimer when you're building and editing you want to focus on the opponent you're fighting and not the Crosshair like we talked about much earlier in today's video the reason you don't only want to look at your Crosshair when building is because if you do you can get shot by the opponent you're fighting since you're not having full awareness over him so simply put it focus on the opponent you're fighting as much as possible you shouldn't have to look at your Crosshair to perform builds and edits consistently you know when you fullbox someone and have insane mechanics doing so but then completely withi your shot well this happens because you're not using the max pompe method so let me tell you how it's done when you f piece an enemy and you're ready to take a shot you want to very quickly change your full attention to your Crosshair I'm talking you should be so focused on your shotgun Crosshair that that's almost the only thing you see and then you want to make the adjustment needed onto the opponent's nose the small white do of the shotgun retical is what you should focus on so easily explained the max pump a method is having full awareness over your opponent when doing impressive builds and edits and then as soon as you get an edit where you have an opportunity to take a shotgun shot you switch your focus exclusively to looking at the Crosshair when you've taken your shot you go back to focusing on the opponent and build an edit like normal now in the beginning if you haven't thought about a strategy like this before the max pump aim method will feel very weird your micro adjustments will feel off and you'll miss a lot of shots maybe you'll get frustrated because your aim isn't as smooth as it has been you'll question yourself and maybe feel like a worse player than you were yesterday but over time you'll not only develop insanely smooth aim with prole click timing but you'll also become someone with almost inhumanly consistent aim do not underestimate the max pump aim method it is seriously the best way of not only getting Elite level aim but it's also the best way to practice him since you'll see everything in even the tiniest detail you'll see how far off the opponent you were every single time you shoot so in other words whether you over flick or under flick maybe you'll notice that your vertical tracking is terrible or that your click timing needs work start using this strategy today and in the next few months you'll be a totally different player the next natural question you'll probably have is how do I practice in the most effective way do I grind ranked create creative or aim trainers the most effective way without question to get good aim in fortnite is to gr creative against good players the reason for this is because if you don't have good aim and play versus good players consistently you lose again and again and again and your brain simply won't allow that to happen if you play for a long enough period against strong players when playing against really solid players over time you'll eliminate your bad habits you'll get pushed to have really good Crosser placement since if you don't you won't have time to adjust onto the opponent before he is close edit on you and gotten a heavy shot off and you'll get aiming practice on much more difficult targets to hit than an average player as a result you'll of course develop better aim than the guy who only grinds against his friend who is pretty mediocre at the game you should aim to play 1 V one to 4v4 finest realistics or 1 V one to 4v4 Pro sonors to develop the best aim possible over time playing things like 20 pump FFA or edit pump force is only good for beginners and given that most of you guys who watch me are already pretty good at the game you won't improve your aim much from playing these kinds of creative Maps ranked is also pretty good to develop good aim but if you have the opportunity to play against genuinely good players in 1 V1 to 44s in Creative I would still rather without question spend my time on this because you'll get in way more reps when playing creative compared to ranked but if you are someone who has a lot of time to put into the game you could easily find a balance between the two for example 3 hours in Creative against really good players and then 1.5 hours grinding ranked fighting everyone you see lastly aim trainers are fantastic to play a little bit every day but there's no point in playing aim trainers like kags or aim Labs if you're only going to play them once a month if you're really serious about getting top tier aim do 12 weeks of daily callbacks or aim labs and I can guarantee you'll have much better aim at the end of f I'll leave the best Cox routine I have ever played in the description below all righty guys you have now gotone the information needed to get Pro level aim all that is left is for you to go out there and grind super hard over the next few months thank you so much for spending some time with me today and I hope this video helped consider checking out tone in the description as a software is seriously impressive thanks guys

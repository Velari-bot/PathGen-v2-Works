pbot is the absolute goat of w King cash cut finals office he drops 30 bombs like it's nobody's business and in this video I'm going to show you a 100 different of his fights have broken down every single Strat and tip and trick that he's using that you guys can easily Implement and especially because he's doing this on high ping as well so you guys can't just type in the comments saying he's on zero pick all right before we get into this this is the biggest how to wke video I've ever done there's so many tips in here lots of useful information and if you guys can hit 3,000 likes on this video I'll try to get petbot on the fighting Master glass just for you I'm going to start with the most simple and easiest tip for you guys to implement into your gameplay and I simply put whenever you're replacing somebody keep your Crosshair on them at all times pbot I think is the perfect example the first thing you should be doing is looking at the visual audio to figure out where your Crosshair roughly should be and then also make sure that the verticality your crossair so how far up or down you're looking is roughly where they would be peeking from this is really really simple to do and it's going to drastically increase how much damage you do with your pumps so right here as P box replacing you can see he makes sure to block out his angles then he regresses the same wall but look he's not smacking on the circle since there's no need to the cone's already low HP and of course if you did that then if the guy did edit you'd have to swing your Crosshair the whole way over this way to try to get a shot as well as adjust for the verticality of that shot as the guy sort of jump Peaks up onto you instead he's keeping his crossair dead on his opponent at all points in time so when he does finally replace it and the guy does go for a counter Peak this actually a pretty good Peak from this guy he a right-hander he's doing a jumping Peak but look he's going to get massively out traded because the fact that pet bot's crossair is already on him and that's really easy to do again as he pressures forward he goes for the edit look his crossair is dead on the opponent which means that he even though the guy's got good movement he's moving to the side he's getting behind his Peak petbot already has his cross head up all he has to do is a little micro adjustment to the side like that and it's very easy to hit that shot and deal more damage in return that is the most easy way to always out trade your opponents is just keep your cross hit on them especially when they're likely to instant edit and try to do damage to you whenever your box fighting or spawn always follow these three steps the first is to look and listen as you approach the wall it's really important you don't just run up to a wall when the guy could be holding instantly an auto shotgun right here petb here and also sees on visual audio the guy's popping a big pot which means he can approach safely with his pickaxe out and go for the insta War replace secondly as you approach the box look what is actually inside the guy's box does he have a cone does he have a stair or in this case he actually has nothing which is really good allows you to do a lot of different plays and thirdly as you break the wall look where the other player is so you can determine what type of edit you're going to do you don't always want to do the same edit you don't always want to do a Mongol classic it depends on where the person is in the Box because a this [ __ ] is popping a big pot and B he's in the center of the box petbot is a really smart play he puts the guy inside of his cone as well as gets the wall at the same time other players POV he's trying to get his big pot off he's scouting round he gets his wall replaced and then see how good this peak is p swings behind his edited window the guy is stuck underneath the cone there's nothing he can do in this situation and he gets banged and he can't even get damage in return as P hits him then Peter just covers his angles lines up the shot and takes makes him out for free this next fight petbot makes a huge mistake as he approaches first of all his opponent is pretty decent hits him for a lot at the start of the fight so what should you guys do in this situation when you're defensively fighting the first thing is to look for counter damage immediately whenever you're the lowest HP right here 60 HP or something this is when you should look for counter damage because your opponent who just hit you is going to be chasing you they're going be running through your old builds they're going to be trying to spray to end the fight quick so you need to look for counter damage at that exact time which is what petbot tries to do he's not able to get off so he reboxes upwards quickly pops a med kit and he's going to look to bait out the opponent again take a look what he does he starts popping a big pot and as he pops the big pot he cancels it so he basically Wast a big pot only pops it like five or so HP and he looks for counter damage on the opponent trying to bait him out how the opponent here is approaching from above so how do you deal with somebody approaching you from above first of all make two boxes and then secondly do not do a type of peak that a lot of players do which is doing a top right hand Peak and the opponent who is standing right here there's a little guy up here I'll draw for you guys he has got a free shot on you no matter what type of peak you do even if you perfectly sit behind it he has got a free shot and you can place the floor or reset something and block it instead try to do what peterb does here it's very hard you need to practice it edits out and hits the one pump as the guy's pressure in that top wall it's very hard to predict from the other guy's POV you can't even see people as he does the play so just make one box and then look for the counter damage just like this hits the bang and ends the fight super quick all right guys there's only two more solo cash cups left in this season if you want a serious shot of making $100 or getting your first time of earnings then check out the solos mastercar 5.0 I know a lot of you guys aren't capable of dropping a 30 bom in finals however the solos masterg is a proven track record we've already had $122,000 mostly in first earnings just from this season alone so far and we've had over 550 different players make their first earnings by using it it is genuinely the best investment you can make I'm going to update it next season and the season after you get free updates for life when you purchase it and it's only $25 go click the link down below if you want to see your name up on the screen right here what do you guys do in this situation when you've got somebody and you've got a cone in their box and they're trying to Rebox and Escape The key thing is the guy's going out to the right here and a lot of you would probably think oh go for the right wall but because Peter bot is in the middle of this box he's a little bit towards the left it's actually quite hard to get that right hand wall and the guy's probably just going to escape and just dart out the back of his box and end up running away and trying to survive for this end game so what peterb does is really smart is he whips out his cone and he puts his Crosshair on top of the wall on the diagonal this means that he's able to get the cone from this extended distance away and then as he jumps up to get a layer up he places the floor at the same time use the reach of the cone and then swap to the floor and you going be able to get the double edit on the other player and of course whenever you get a double edit try to get the back walls so he gets this wall out to the side here and now the guys got only one option which is trying to run back into this box or he just runs straight into the wall in this case and he goes down if you guys ever completely shambles during a solos game really simply just go do the EMP trick on a vending machine figure out where the nearest healing vending machine is carry some emps over to it you can either Buy direct heals or big pots from the vendor or you can just go throw a bunch of emps on it and then buy big pots as well as medkits you have the gold load out for w King with one of the best get out jail free cards you can use when you're fighting especially when you're in a bad spot like right here he's directly on the wall the stair is not in the correct position is just place a stair inside their box if they're at the back of the box what's going to happen is they're going to be placed underneath the stair and you can do any type of edit to get a free shot on them if they're in the midpoint in the box they're a little bit closer that means they're going to get yellowed inside the St and it's going to be hard for them to see you unless their Crosshair is perfectly lined up they're going to miss the shot and often times if they're close to the wall like that like this guy is what will happen is they'll get bumped up on top of the stair and it'll mess up their Crosshair placement and their character will actually miss the shot just because you place the stair in the Box you can see Peter do it again in the second here he approaches the Box in not the best fashion he's hopping directly onto a left hand Peak and take a look what he does he just places a stair inside the guy's box the guy phases he completely misses his shot out pass cuz he can't see what's going on and people able to use that to close the fight really quickly whenever you're in a bad situation you're a bad Peak just force to stay in somebody these box again exact same thing here the guy's not got a Coe in his box he's not countering this at all P's going to go directly on his wall as soon as he waxs open that three tile edit forces a stay in and allows him to finish the fight really simply right here this is a really common situation you might find yourself in game somebody's got a stereo VI and you've only got the floor below you so how do you quickly turn this situation into an to counter piece somebody what petbot does is he edits a single tile down at the back of the box so the guy can't just 50/50 him it's very awkward 50/50 that and he goes ahead and leads the tile open which is a really key thing this allows him to get the wall as well as very quickly spray through and replace the stair with the burst SMG at this point in time as well he's got the back wall from placing both walls at the same time just from this single piece that he's left open so first of all he's got out the box and then immediately turned that single edit down into full piece the guy and possibly line up a Max damage shot right there it's a very hard shot to hit in return guy completely mistimes his shot and Pete is able to take out the fight very cleanly what he does is he baits the fact that he's going the other way opens the window and the guys's trying to line up a pre-fire shot on Pet's foot and he's goes straight down without doing any more damage in return if you guys want to get better at box fighting even if you're not the best ping like pbot try to just make opponent's WS low HP right here he gets the wall one shot doesn't go for the pickaxe instead he goes for the replace with his AR which means he can immedi follow up by spraying with his AR gets the cone and then takes the opponent out he does the exact same thing this next fight gets a bit of damage to start with and take a look what he does pickaxes and then tries to get the pickaxe wall timing and as he does this he's placing the cone through the box and then take a look what he does he shoots the wall so it's already low HP and this means as the opponent opens up a pretty typical Peak he's going to try to do a top R Peak because P bot's already shot the wall he's already got the wall to HP he can then instant take it with his pickaxe as the opponent's got his gun out and get free kill just like that make sure you guys are pressuring wall as much as possible use your ARS use your shotguns to actually get the walls to low HP and especially during early game fights this is how you end them very quickly B's next fight shows two really useful tips and tricks as he follows this other player down and tries to hunt him down the first one this is very typical is just placing a stair right here however a good player in this situation if you're just standing on their wall with a stair is going to do some type of instant edit is going to try to get some counter damage and do some damage to you in return the key thing is as you drop down to the wall out here is look as far as possible into the ground this means even though you're still a whole tile layer above people actually on the above layer still he's able to grab the wall on the opponent just by looking down into the floor as you can see he gets that wall and now he's going to pressure the opponent who's forced to run out and he's able to get cracked from the back now here as Peter regresses the opponent wants to end this fight quick look what he does he shoots the wall as he approaches which is really important and now at this point point in time doesn't matter if you've got a gray pump a gray auto if somebody does an edit reset and you've shot their wall it's going to be one shot to any gun in the game and you can just get straight in doesn't matter if it's a metal wall or if it's a brick wall or wood wall it's always going to be one p you can get straight in first of all pet very nicely this places a stare inside the guy's box as he does the edit reset so he gets a stairing shotguns in and then sprays through and takes the guy out really simply and immediately gets out the box so he doesn't get third parted by somebody that might be lcking nearby one thing that petbot does really well is limiting how much space people can make especially when they're just sitting in one box like he's pre piecing everything he's blocking all the angles the guy decides to finally go up so take a look at how he limits his space and prevents him from going up again he just looks above the Box in this sort of region just put your crossover right there and you'll be able to place a floor through the other guy's cone just like that and now the guy cannot go upwards anymore and you've limited his options again from here you can just continue to piece the side wait for what he's going to do and then try to pressure him and one thing is just don't constantly smack on walls it's better to just lock off space and then spray and that's going to help you end fights a lot quicker here a play that a lot of Pros mess up but people actually makes it work a lot of the time and catches players off with it the key thing is to pressure the top enough and give the guy very limited Escape options either he stays in the same box getting pressured from the top or he has to Rebox below so what pbot does is he drops down cones himself and then gets this wall right here as well as he gets the back wall the side wall and The Cone then all he does is wait about a second or two for the guy to drop down he realizes the guy is still staying in the same box so he presses his floor and the guy just forced to run away and die a little bit later on it's really important you pressure the top and then go for the drop down piece you don't just randomly start piecing up the bottom which you see a lot of Pros doing whenever you're trying to end a fight versus somebody who's often times just running away in reboxing always just look to see if you can get a con petbot does there from below again very easy to do and when he does that he's trying to look to catch the guy in Escape he's not just jumping in straight away have a normally what will happen whenever somebody doesn't place a cone in to begin with is they're not going to place a cone in their box again always check if they've got a cone inside their box or not and one thing you can do is just look in this sort of area put your crossair around there while holding a cone out and you'll be able to get a cone in their box as long as it's not completely flat on the ground and there's no other floors around it however here pet realizes the hill is going to work in his favor so look what he does he goes underneath while he's reloading his AR gets the cone in as the guy's in the center of his box and now the guy trapped in his cone and then all you do is walk through and stand up and you be a to take him out this is a really smart bait out player you can use right here petbot smacking on his wall and he hears the other opponent edit out and he's not editing this left hand side wall which means he's likely to run away take a look what he does he does a double edit places the full box below the guy and gets the 108 tag and the key thing is instead of trying to rush and jumping in the guy's box right here he just sprays through this AR and as he's spraying he looks up and grabs the cone to prevent the guy from reboxing always look to see if you can get an extended cone when you're spraying through some of these builds instead of just trying to end the fight since normally it will actually help you end the fight sooner by preventing them from reboxing upwards then from there he just hops in and sprays his AR while walking forward to get easy kill here's three really useful tips that petbot uses as he pressures other players this guy's just running away for some reason first all is as he's chasing him down he backwards stairs towards him instead of grappling whenever you grapple you've got a delay when you use it as well as when you land Mak it quite hard to piece but the backward stairs especially chasing somebody down like this you accelerate really quickly and he almost takes the guy out by catching off guard and grabbing his wall as he slid into him the next is as he's approaching the box right here and swinging on the guy's wall he spots that the guy places a stair whenever you see a stair get placed in someone's box it really means that they're just going to go up either they're going to go up to the side or they're just going to go straight up people have realizes this prees and blocks everything around them to make sure he's safe then he does this nice little triangle edit and gets a double cone on the guy and the guy standing here looking absolutely clueless and he's able to just finally get out on barely any HP and then finally to close out the fight without taking any more damage from this kill just been running away he does this absolutely god tier Peak you guys should always be using this when you've got some many full box and you don't want to take damage in return all you do is peek like this and the other guy can't even get damage on you as you peek over the top and you're able to get a free MAX body pump a lot of time or even a headshot line up pretty easily this next fight is a perfect example of first of all how to approach somebody so you know you've got a massive advantage over them as well as how to counter the sort of 2x two STP where people would loads of boxes first of all Peter knows this guy's just come out of storm and he's going to cancel his Med kit before he can even think of getting this and he gets a damage Advantage with his AR which is really important damage advantage of the season are so important it means you can always take somebody out very quickly and in the fight secondly this is the most common thing I see this season is somebody gets tagged 20 and they build a 2 by two out brick I'm not going to say who did this for the meta but it's very annoying to fight against but here's how Peter deals with it first of all is he breaks the wall as the guys coming to the hill and he looks for what the guy is missing and as you can see the guy is missing all of the center pieces in his box close walls which a lot of Peters Miss as well as the cones so what Peter does is he places that close wall and of course the other guy being low HP he's trying to get a counter shot he shoots the wall since Peter plays it at the correct time and now he swings behind his Peak slides in the cone remember cones are so good you get him from long distance and takes him out straight away in the back takes the guy out in less than 10 seconds from the initiation of the fight and now he's super stacked cat mats with a perfect load out to keep on WK here is how to fight when you're low HP a lot of players struggle with this they play Super passive they play really bad Peaks that aren't going to get in damage in return however pbot plays this extremely well he does about six shotgun shots without taking any damage in return apart from one trade pump that he did to get the Mythic shotgun right here first of all jumping Peak very simple and safe and then secondly is he doesn't edit reset bait on this guy which is really smart the guy is's very limited in options his side walls already L be does an edit reset bait out then he forces the stair in but Waits on the edit doesn't inst the edit cuz the guy could just be standing there trying to get a timing shot and return and then again hit doesn't Rush this edit just just a simple window Peak as he chases the guy down doesn't want to commit into a bad angle unfortunately here the guy baits him out hides behind the stair and but doesn't get a stare up just in time however knowing that the guy has got a shotgun delay this is actually a safe Peak to do a lot of people think this is a stupid Peak to do the guy could shoot in return but the guy has shotgun delay that is the really important part about this peak he gets that shot and then there's a right hand window and of course the guy can't even see pet B he's completely stuffed in by the window and he gets a free kill in return however immediately after this he's 16 HP and another player pushes him however now he has mats to play with so what does he do reboxes upwards straight away and then reboxes outwards so he's created a little bit of distance and space for himself from the other player and then take a look at how he counter Peaks this first of all he's moving around in between his boxes making it hard for him to get tracked where the other player is and this means that as the other player now 50/50s and runs into his box pbot can swap into the other box he swaps holds his stair for a second then he opens up as the guy's going to break it get that free timing shot right there and then there's this really smart Peak knowing the guy's going to panic because he's in Pet's full box and he's going to try to rush out he just runs around the side jumps from some weird angle catches the guy off guard and now gets super stacked on heels and of course he's ready to win the rest of this game one of the absolute biggest skills in fighting is knowing what type of edit or what type of play to do depending on where somebody is within a single box right here Pete is chasing this other guy down he gets the wall and there's a lot of different edits he could do in this situation on this other player the key reason why he decides not to do the cone like he did earlier compared to doing a stair edit which he's going to do in a second is because the guy could actually since he's at the back of his box get bumped up behind the cone it would sort of block Peter shot and then he'd be able to sort of right hand Peak or do a Crouch Peak or something and actually hit Peter in return and pet is quite low in this situation and he can easily die to that instead what he does is the perfect Ed it again assess where the other player is in the box and figure out what edit is best to do in that situation and as you can see the reliable Mongol classic is perfect here because the guy's crossair is completely blocked it's the perfect use case of a [ __ ] classic takes no damage in return and he gets a nice free kill always look what the other person is doing and look where they're standing in their box before you make an edit

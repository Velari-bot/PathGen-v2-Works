today guys I want to break down one of the most crucial aspects of Trio gameplay this is going to be how to igl in trios as you guys know in 2025 the main fncs game mode is going to be trios so this video is crucial for anybody that wants to try an igl for their Trio in my opinion this is the most important role on any single Team game mode in every single season you guys need to know how to master how to be an IG so be sure to stick around to the end let's get right into it so being a trio guys means that you need clear leadership whether you're the igl or not everyone needs to be on the same page as a result the first rule of leading is simple always have a plan this doesn't just mean winging your decisions and kind of going crazy you want to know exactly where you're going especially during rotations a good igl understands the map in the best spots for dead side rotations dead side means avoiding the busier areas and going towards the edge side of the map where the Storm Circle is because that's where fewer teams are going to be positioned and it's going to help keep you safe knowing your drop spot is only part of the equation what's more important is having a clear path for each Storm Circle let's say for example that Circle 2 pulls Far North or you're stuck on the edge of Circle 3 that's when you need to have your route planned out but also be flexible backup plans are critical when IG Ling because things rarely go to plan as expected if another team beats you to your usual rotation path or a fight breaks out don't panic just switch it up identify a new spot and A New Path to base up or to rotate to the Zone basically what this means that you need to always have a plan and lead the team when it comes to rotating efficiently now the second aspect is also crucial this is going to be micromanaging in order to avoid tunnel vision I believe that eyes and igl you should constantly be micromanaging every single thing that your Fragger and your support player are doing in the middle of a high press game it's easy to get stuff like tunnel vision which is focusing too hard on what's directly in front of you and losing sight of the bigger picture of the game this can combinate the example of maybe focusing too much on a kill focusing too much on some loot that you want to get in general tunnel vision is a problem that's where micromanaging as an igl should come in you should constantly be managing both the fight and the map to make sure that you and your team are all on the same page and nobody's overc committing to anything keeping your team in line might sound simple but in reality it takes a lot of focus in chaotic moments like rotating while boxed up or preparing to take height you need to be the one thinking two steps ahead watch for what's happening around you and call out the next move it could be something as simple as stay hidden we're playing for placement or we're taking height on the next Zone those are examples of comms that I think are really good but make sure you guys don't let your team stray away from the plan understand that micromanaging helps avoid that tunnel vision and keeps everyone focused on the Wind now another crucial tip guys is having confidence in your calls in my opinion this is actually the most important thing for an igl especially in modern day because a lot of people know the basic rotations they have the game sense especially if you're a mediocre level competitive player you're going to be having that amount of knowledge however one thing that separates average a from great ones is confidence confidence doesn't mean you'll always make the right decision it means that you believe in your calls and you stick with them until proven otherwise sometimes there will be situations where you guys will make a call and it will end up not being the right one however you need to understand to take accountability for your actions be confident in those calls regardless and learn from your mistakes in a game you don't always have time to overthink things you got to make the call Push or Retreat rotate High ground or low ground and your teammates will follow the best igl such as buga and quezy they don't second guess themselves in the middle of the match they trust their instincts built through the hours of practice and vview that they've done and if you make a mistake own it in vviews or scrims make sure to analyze what went wrong in the last game and adjust it for the next one the more confident you are in your calls the more teams will trust you which makes your entire operation as an igl much smoother and to kind of build off that I want to explain why you guys should think fast and not hesitate your decision-making speed is crucial the truth is fortnite is a very fast-paced game especially in trios matches you don't have times to debate every single move with your teammates the more you hesitate the more you're giving the enemy a chance to take control and interfere with your game plan look at top igl's once again like quezy and Booga they're always moving always adapting they've mastered the ability to make quick decisions and live with the consequences you're not going to be perfect every time but that's what practice is for in scrims or casual matches focus on making faster decisions and learning from your mistakes the more you practice this and the more reps you get in the better your decision- making will become and eventually it'll feel like second nature like it does for all those professional igl's in my opinion this is something you guys can kind of combine with the confidence in the coms section if you guys are confident and you guys don't hesitate on your calls that's going to make your team trust you a lot more and likely what that will do as well is give you guys a really good sense of Team chemistry that's something a lot of igls tend to overlook your team needs to really trust one another and believe in the calls of the igl now guys the final section is going to be about mastering coms in my opinion this is the most actual mechanical aspect of being an igl it's literally what you're saying to your team it's what you guys are trying to tell them to do and where they're trying to go maybe who to fight there's a lot of different variant of cing communication is everything in trios this has been the case since chapter 2 when trios fncs really took the front stage the best trios that won everything such as Camy setti day mirror reverse they all had incredible comms that were very chill very not aggressive and very not hectic and it's also not just about talking in your intonation it's also about saying the right things at the right time and understanding how your team reacts to these specific calls for example if you get a kill and you want to keep pushing in your Comm should be something like push in push in we're cleaning up the fight however if you guys want to slow down and regroup be something like chill chill take it slow reset those two examples are crucial because you're not going to be just yelling random nonsense you're going to be yelling either push in or chill it's two different things that mean exactly what you think they mean so there's no misunderstanding these simple effective coms make sure everyone knows the plan which reduces confusion in these chaotic moments we we can break through this yeah we need to get in the house we got to be very careful yeah we need to get there I have so many risk be a lot of times I'm seeing teams lose these fights because they don't have any good Cs on their positioning the enemy players Health their status how much ammo they have whatever it is they are not communicating in the fight it's important to tailor your coms to how your teammates react so some players get really fired up with aggressive coms so if your teammate likes aggressive coms you can do that however others might need calmer more measured instructions to keep them focused in the game the more you play with the team the more you'll learn to how they respond to different styles of communication my recommendation is tested out in different games let's say one scrim game you guys calm really aggressively let's say you do a little bit better let's say the next scrim game you guys calm a little more chill and it doesn't really work as well maybe you guys should stick to aggressive comms I'm not saying there's anything inherently bad with aggressive coms but in my opinion I do believe that calm chill comms those are the right things and those are the right way to coms for you guys as a general umbrella over all this information what you guys need to understand is this as an igl your main opponent isn't the enemy players that are around you it's going to be the Zone in the terrain zone is going to be the thing that you guys are trying to rotate away from you guys don't want to take storm damage you will get eliminated if you're in the storm for too long obviously so that's why you need to avoid it terrain is the next thing let's say you guys are next to a mountain and this big mountain is there and zones closing on on you you have to get over this literal hump which is the literal Mountain that's going to be the terrain problem if you guys go into every single game with the mindset I need to focus on getting away from Zone and the terrain you guys will be an extremely good igl make sure to obviously follow all the other tips that I went over those things are crucial and if you guys do so I promise you your IG Ling skills will pay off and you guys will be much better than you are now but guys that is the video on how to igl in chapter 5 I also want this to extend into chapter 6 into the 2025 year coming I want you to understand being a great igl is much more than just having good game sense you need to know how to also project that information onto your team keep them calm and

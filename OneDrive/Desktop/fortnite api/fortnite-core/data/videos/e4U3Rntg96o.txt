do you struggle in ranked but are a God and creative if so then this video is for you today I'll be going over the necessary tips in order of transferring your creative Talent into ranked and tournaments I was just in this situation a few months ago and now I'm managing to get 20 to 30 kill wins in ranked after using these tips make sure to watch till the end so you don't miss anything and hit that subscribe button because I do put a lot of effort into these videos start off we need to talk about how real games are way more laggy than creative one thing I do to get used to the in-game lag is practice building on a different server for instance I'm usually 40 Ms on Central but I'll switch it to na West where I get around 80 Ms and freebuild for about 15 to 20 minutes this will get me used to the in-game lag while still allowing me to warm up something else I want to touch on real quick is trying to simulate real in-game FPS drops one thing you can try is just lowering your frame rate limit but it won't replicate the same feeling you have for in-game FPS drops so what I usually do is open a stream in the background and when I'm practicing in creative I can feel the inconsistency in my FPS if you can't feel the FPS drops yet you can try opening more tabs on Google or opening something like an editing software in the background you can do this at the same time as switching your region and it can feel just as laggy as a real game so you can get the full experience something else you have to do is just simply play more ranked if you're playing ranked more than creative it'll be easier for your mind to get used to the Ping difference and the delay but obviously creative is still needed in scenarios where you want to practice your mechanics control or just have fun with your friends next we need to talk about confidence the reason we do so well in Creative but then struggle in game is because there is nothing on the line you can die in creative and respawn but when you die in a real game you either go down and rank or start doing worse in the tournament so to fix your confidence in real game fighting scenarios I would suggest speed realistics what you need to do is fight the way you would in a real game make sure you're playing patiently and taking good angles now another way to fix your confidence in game is to just not care what you have to realize is that no one cares about what rank you are or what place you get in a tournament so why should you although caring about doing good isn't a bad thing if you're getting to Real by camping the whole time that's not going to help you become a better fighter you need to practice putting yourselves in different in-game fighting scenarios so you become more and more comfortable which will lead to you having more confidence now to get more confident in endgame scenarios I would suggest playing scrims I'll leave a few servers you can join in the description make sure to check them out but basically if you're doing scrims every night for a few hours over time end games and tournaments will feel easier than they used to and you'll feel way more comfortable in end game now the next thing I want to talk about is understanding how a real game works if you're someone who only plays creative then the chances are you don't understand the structure of a competitive tournament it can take multiple seasons for you to gain the experience of playing in the real game but this is where you need to find yourself a really good igl to cover all your weaknesses or the other choice is to step up and become that igl but that decision takes a lot of hard work and dedication if you want to learn how to change your fighting style from creative to endgame you need to watch the best Pros I would suggest going into the replay system and watch someone who is a crazy fighter make sure you're choosing the best of the best though your favorite pro might be Mong but the best decision on who to watch might be Venom now try to watch their fight once or twice see how they approach the fight what angles they take and how they finish the fight think about why they do what they do this will help help you almost understand their thought process and you can put yourself in their shoes now the next thing I want to talk about is struggling with mechanics you do all these edit courses and all these peace control Maps but your mechanics still don't look fast or smooth now copying your favorite Pros sensitivity or key binds won't help you at all you need to find what is right and comfortable for you for instance I use my pinky finger to crouch and place a cone but some people might find that uncomfortable it'll take a lot of time messing around in Creative to find what's comfortable for you but it's definitely worth it in the long run now the same thing for sensitivity using Peter bot's sensitivity will not give you his aim or mechanics you need to find what's comfortable for you for instance I use 6.4 with 800 DPI but some people might find that sense to be too slow for them once you find the right binds that are comfortable for you and the right sensitivity this is where you begin practicing you start by getting yourself prepared for ranked by doing aim training peace control and mechanics and then once you're comfortable you head into the real game next thing you you need to do is stop trying to be flashy if you're trying to go for a clip every fight you're never going to improve you need to focus on what your opponent is doing to try and kill you rather than how fast your edits are over time you will end up being able to edit fast and hit clips and ranks but at the start you need to set up good Peaks and play slow I would suggest going into ranked playing patiently and stop trying to clip the person or do too many extra edits just play your angles and try to get the kill most of the time people who are doing too much will end up making more mistakes since they're putting less go into their game play That's why when you're consistent with your building aiming and editing you'll usually outplay people who are trying to be super fast in Raiders map he has a scenario for you to practice your Peaks I would suggest trying this out if you're not really good at peeking in fights and want to get better the next thing I want to talk about and arguably the most important is your practice habits there are so many unrealistic Maps out there that will never help you improve like casual 1V ons or Zone Wars the best Maps used to practice ingame fighting scenarios are any realistic maps you can do one V ons or 2v tws with your Duo the best way to practice in this map is to play it like it's a real game you need to try ending your fights quick and saving as many mats as possible let's talk about why it's so important to get good and ranked the reason you want to get good and ranked is so you can do good in tournaments too the chances are if you can get 20 kills in a ranked game then when you load into your first game of a solo cash cup or Duo cash Dash cup you should be able to do the same I also just wanted to touch on my creative map I made it has peace control mechanics and aim training I just added all the new chapter 5 weapons and mod benches so you can practice with the new guns and your favorite attachments I also plan on adding a lot more to the map so make sure to type in unreal practice and click the one with a good thumbnail if you do favor the map let me know in the comments also let me know what other practice scenarios you think I should add the code will be in the description make sure to check it out the next thing we need to touch on is overthinking the reason you're playing so well in Creative is because you're simply just playing the game once you head into a real game you're so overwhelmed with the thought that you can't die which will cause you to overthink every decision you make a good way to match the same overthinking in Creative is to play competitive box fights or realistics against your friends now since something is on the line this will cause you to have the same adrenaline rush and the same feeling as playing in a real game over time you'll get so used to this feeling that it won't even bother you as much this will help you get rid of nerves before tournaments which will overall help your performance another thing to talk about is caffeine although caffeine is proven to help you perform better it can also make you feel nervous and anxious I don't really recommend it if you're already nervous before a tournament because now it'll make your nerves 10 times worse and cause you to overthink almost every decision you make if you're sleeping a good amount and you've had a good warmup you should have nothing to worry about before hopping into a tournament if you are worrying about stuff before tournaments then you should have everything completed before hand for instance if you have a big assignment you are working on you shouldn't wait till after a tournament to start working on it if you do then you will have that in the back of your head for the next 3 hours causing you to overthink about something that's not even related to the game that's why it's so important to follow all these tips and even set up a schedule for yourself so you can try improving in ranked the best thing to do is find someone that has the same goal as you which is to transfer your creative skill to end game once you find this person you need to practice together and try holding each other accountable like let me know how your progress goes in the comments below and also don't forget to subscribe peace out

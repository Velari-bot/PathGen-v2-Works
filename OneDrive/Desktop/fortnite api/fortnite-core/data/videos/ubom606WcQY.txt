guys let me take the time to describe to you the most frustrating feeling in fortnite you take the time to practice in Creative you fight your friends you fight your enemies you fight everyone left and right and you do amazing you pop off you do really really good and for some reason as soon as you black out of that game and click ranked it all falls apart today we're going to see that Gap we're going to find out why that is and we're going to fix it so that you don't have to have this feeling anymore today it's going to be the day that all changes and I'm going to outline for you exactly how to do that keep watching here's how I would like to frame this problem the problem stands as such the first 80% of getting better at the game revolves purely around fighting and this in my opinion can fully be solved in creative and so we should we should do that why should we do that creative offers a really good environment for us to maximize volume because at 30 minutes of a rank game we really don't have all that many fights that we can take it might be between 10 to 15 fights but in comparison if you look at how many fights you can do in 30 minutes of creative 1 V1 realistics it becomes really obvious that the volume in Creative is really really good favors us and you know how many fights we get into really does matter it matters a lot in terms of your improvement and how fast you get good so why should we need to practice ranked at all well you remember creative only accounts for the first 80% the missing 20 % really is important for you to perform well in ranked this is the gap you need to find out what this Gap consists of and what this Gap involves so you can solve for it and then after that you will be at 100% and you will perform in ranked and today in this video in Rapid Fire format I'm going to tell you the top 10 things that I think will summarize the last 20% so you can finally perform well in ranked and also in tournaments let's get right into it so the first difference between creative and ranked is the fact that in Creative we don't actually have to constantly be aware of our surroundings we don't need to fight and then check our back we don't need to roam around and look around for snipers we don't need to check bushes we don't need to check the indoors of our houses and these are things that will catch you off guard if you're not ready for it and when we practice creative since we don't have a need for it we almost condition our brains to build this bad habit of being unaware and so when we get into ranked be aware of this difference be aware that this exists we need to fully be aware and this starts by looking around you need to look in all directions while you're roaming around this includes behind you this includes places you haven't recently cleared you always constantly need to be looking around because if you haven't looked in a certain direction for the past 10 seconds and then you get sniped in that direction then I only have you to blame head snipe it's really really important that we spot these threats before they start shooting because that's how we can stop the initial beam and we can stop disadvantage that they start to fight with huge difference guys write this one down make sure you solve for this the second issue that ranked has that creative really doesn't have a problem of is Resource Management well then first you might think like oh zoma we can just play realistics right it has limited mats true but realistics is also misleading the fact of the matter is your opponent and you will not always start with the same amount of mats and having the skill of trying to guess or make a good judgment call on how many mats your opponent has relative to the duration of the game that has passed thus far is really really important it's really important to play differently and contextually in these situations and you have to adapt to these situations accordingly um because it's really important to play off spawn correctly because you only have five build it's really important to play the mid game correctly because maybe you're more scuffed than usual as you would expect someone to be at the 10-minute Mark and you only have 30 builds but you would expect your enemy to have Max mats and so this promotes more of a 50/50 play style because you need to end the fight quickly to have any chance of coming back at all and so these things are really important you can't find this in Creative it's is really important to understand guys so take note of this one as well and on to the third the third difference that creative doesn't have but ranked has is rotates and positioning Zone exists and Zone can absolutely make a difference in your fight and it's really important to account for it before your fight during your fight and after your fight so it's really important to always check your map and make sure you understand where zone is and what that means for your fight and check how much time there is before Zone starts moving and which zone it is also matters because a one tick zone is not as threatening as a five tick Zone and it's really important to take into account Zone in your fights because this is not something that we have to do at all in Creative but in ranked matches this is something to consider because this can then affect your future fights because maybe you're good enough to win the current fight but because it was so scuffed and the fact that you know zone is pulling super super far you were now tanking stone for super long which then puts you behind Tempo on the game which then puts you behind on Match which can then put you into an unfavored fight that you could have solved for had you considered Zone before that let me put it this way here's a golden rule that you can follow for any ranked match there is solve for Zone first just go to Zone and then fight in zone if you just do it in that order almost every single time you can pretty much solve for Zone very easily and another thing that you can consider is how close zone is if zone is super close then of course you can fight outside of Zone because you could just take five steps and you're in and so use all of these factors to decide whether you've taken Zone into consideration and if if you have then I think you're going to have a much easier time in ranked because we simply don't have the means to practice this in creative and so this is going to be a weakness or a gap when we actually hop into the real games the fourth difference is the fact that we struggle to adapt to loot RNG because we don't have loot RNG in realistics or creative as a matter of fact it's perfectly equal yes sometimes Maps can have relatively different loot but there's not really the fact that we need to consider hey this chest may not give me what I want we need to account for that right we need to plan ahead for that and so offs spawn Dynamics don't exist in Creative we need to account for that and be aware of it so that we can better be prepared for real games and so when you do hop into the real game after solving for the first 80% then you need to solve for this this is a really missing piece in a lot of people's behavior they tend to think that hey just because I opened five CHF and ran over eight floor spawns I deserve to get a full load out with full shield maybe but like sometimes that doesn't happen plan for this guys it's it's not too hard to plan for I really believe it I think as long as you have a decision for when it becomes bad and a decision for when it becomes good then I think you have really really good planning if you've ever played creative for a prolonged amount of time and you've played 1 V ones and you've gotten really really good individually but then you go to play with your friends in a duo trio or Squad environment you'll notice that although that you are individually good it becomes very difficult to track all these people and that's another difference that makes it very difficult to transfer your creative to rank games and I think that this requires some individual practice of tracking think about it in a 1V one setting you only need to track one person and that's your enemy and in a 2v2 setting you need to actually track three people yes not two but three people you need to track both enemies but you also need to track what your teammates doing and where they're located because this is part of the decision-making process on what you should do next this is very difficult for most people and what I could say to immediately improve this skill is to practice 2v tws in Creative go to any scrim server have a Duo and go find 2v2 realistics or 2v2 Zone Wars or anything fight based that is 2v2 to help improve this aspect of your game so that when you do go into a real match it's not going to be alien to you and it's going to be something that you so comfortable with because of how many reps you put in in Creative for these 2v2 or even 3v3 fights another aspect of making sure that you're absolutely comfortable in a rank match even though you practice a lot in Creative is understand that the difference can also be within your inventory in creating if we're given our inventory we're not we don't get to choose but when we loot up in a ranked match we have to understand certain Dynamics and certain inventory setups that would really help us play better for example if you're playing Duos and neither of you are carrying whites in any capacity that will not be good for you in the long term because if any one of you guys get cracked and take white damage then you're not going to be able to heal it to any capacity another example of good inventory management is understanding that hey if you find one big and you find two splashes and you have a lot to lose left in your POI maybe taking the big is actually better because of the fact that bigs have a higher likelihood of spawning in the likelihood that you're going to get Max splashes is really low so managing this and making sure you pick up the right item in these situations is really really useful another thing that you can do with inventory that is just impossible to practice in Creative estimating what the average loot of a player you might run into would look like because the later in the game it is the more stacked people actually are in their inventory but if I'm fighting someone at 3 or 4 minutes I can expect that person to be really scuffed comparatively to someone at 10 minutes and so estimating this and having a sort of intuitive feeling for this is really really useful and that's not something that we can guess in Creative yet another difference that we have is engagement with multiple opponents or the threat of third parties this is a very difficult one because yes sometimes there are maps that we can use to practice but what I'm really referring to here guys is talking about third parties when you don't expect them because if you were to play a map where third parties are expected it's a lot easier to defend against that and a lot of people actually do well on these Maps because they're expecting it but if you're 2v2 in someone or even one V oneing someone and you're not used to you know expecting the third party or the threat of the third party or even looking around to search for them this is going to catch you off guard and it's going to get you killed for quite a long time until you get used to this this is not something that you can actually practice in creative and I really do think that once you've become competent at fighting individually then going into rank to solve for this thing as well is a much better better solution than playing third party Maps because third party Maps as I said before is expected you know it's coming so it's not as potent sometimes practicing this in ranked or tournaments is a more efficient way of getting this done difference number eight is nervousness or stress the fact of the matter is just because a ranked or a tournament match is a much longer game because we're investing 20 to 30 minutes per match now we are actually kind of nervous to mess it up this is a good or bad thing right obviously it's going to make us play worse but this is rather not something that we should avoid or ignore but something to get accustomed to a lot of people try to lose the stress they try to get rid of it or ignore it or not feel it but I disagree I don't think that's the right way to think about it like the reason you care is because this match is important so instead of turning it into nervousness channel the same energy into adrenaline and that will help you as long as it's managed well you know and not overboard it will help you perform better that's what I'm looking for I really do think that stress can be a positive thing as long as you put it into the right direction and use it to perform better difference number nine guys is fighting different enemies with different play Styles you guys know this often times when we one one in Creative we have the issue of fighting the same person over and over so we subconsciously get used to their play style in ranked or in tournaments we don't have that benefit and so often times when people finally get individually competent after months and months of training whether it be through fighting and creative or whatever it might be they need to get into ranked for that last 20% and really get used to fighting different play Styles because some people are really really cringe with boxing up all the time and some people are really really cringe of jumping right in with super low HP in an unexpected fashion and you need to be ready for both extremes often times I'll hear students talking about oh my God this guy jumped in my box and it wasn't a good play but it worked well it only worked because he weren't ready for it and so you need to be prepared because if a pro player faced that person would they struggle would they have trouble would they expect it they absolutely would expect that play coming because they're constantly thinking about the worst case scenario and are super ready for any and all play styles that the enemy throws at them because of experience because of skill because of their practice and so when you get into rank games expect this to also be a problem because in Creative all we're used to doing is fighting the same person over and over and yes although we can kind of you know fight against that by fighting different types of players it's not the same thing as fighting one player each time that has a completely different play style individually because in ranked match we might fight 15 to 20 players and all 15 to 20 players have a completely different way of taking the game and that can throw us off getting used to that is a skill and the last difference guys but arguably one of the most important differences is the fact that ping and input delay is a huge difference compared to creative you don't feel the same way as you do in Creative when you hop into a rank match and that's key getting used to this takes experience and time and volume of practice just like anything else yeah yes we could you know maybe play on West in Creative to try to make a fake ping but honestly guys I do think getting used to just playing ranked matches for and it it doesn't take that long I really do believe that this is one of the best ways to get used to it just play ranked matches it's not a big deal because most of the Reps or the game sense of fighting or anything that you do practice-wise can be done in Creative but then when you go into a rank match we're only trying to fix the rest the small differences there are between creative and ranked we don't need to practice fighting itself because we fixed all of that but we're going to try to practice building on 20 higher ping that it's that simple guys and honestly that doesn't take that long 20 to 30 ranked matches and I really do think you'll be accustomed to it so this is partly why I leave it till the end mechanically it's going to be a hindrance but you have to remember every person you're fighting is dealing with the same hindrance they don't have you know zero paying like they do on Creative hopefully knowing that brings you some comfort and hopefully knowing that actually helps you fight against the other person with some confidence guys there are a lot of small differences between creative and rank but one of the most important things that I can tell you is to be aware of them just like I've listed them out in this video and try to knock them off your list one by one with practice once you genuinely feel like you've knocked it out of the park in terms of fighting with mechanics with decisions in fighting because you practiced creative so much against better and better players and you've gotten to that level where you feel really really comfortable individually then solving for these 10 differences in ranked will complete you as a player guys this isn't just for ranked this is truly for tournaments and Grims as well knowing that these things can happen to you in any real match is truly what makes you a great player because there are so many creative Warriors out there but a lot of them don't realize their true potential purely because they don't account for these differences and they truly think that creative is somehow the exact same thing as the real match when it's not it's very close but there are significant differences that need to be accounted for and once you've practiced these you are unstoppable you will be really really good thank you guys so much for watching and

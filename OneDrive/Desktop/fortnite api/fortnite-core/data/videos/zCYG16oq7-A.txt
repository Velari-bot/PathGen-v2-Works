yo what is up guys back with another tips and tricks video in this video it's going to be how to become a tier one igl like I've been getting mad comments mad F questions can how do you become igl what do I do for IG and I'm here to tell you and I'm going to teach you how to become a better igl because as you guys know I've been qualifying for these dual cash CS with new fraggers I just qualified with mzz and then I just qualified with re we before you know what I'm saying how to become a better igl no matter who would you play with right of course these players are good players but you got to understand that igl is one of the biggest factors in any game of fortnite and I would say IG Ling is around 75% of the game like you play a game your igl has to lock in for you 75% of the time I have five tips I'm going to tell you guys and I'm going to also explain all thoroughly so let's go to my Google doc right here these are my top five right here number one is leadership and communication which means taking charge being confident in your calls doing things where you know that you're Elling like you know what you're doing and you let your frager follow and communication same thing it's like in your coms you want to be very vocal and you want to be very confident you don't want to just talk and be like oh what what should we do here do you think this is a good idea like bro you're the igl lock in it's your call if you sell it's on you and communication more is like talking and understanding about where your Fragger is at and what to do to help your Fragger follow you like follow you better while you're leading number two I'm going to teach is rotations okay understanding where to rotate how to go get a r down and how to get into endgame stacked because I know a lot of people that don't know how to rotate and they end up getting on congested side rotating with so many people around them and they just end up getting killed and I'm going to be showing dual cash cups of how I played right I just played the tournament literally like two hours ago and I'm going to go back show that and I'm also going to show the VOD from last week with me playing with re number three is where to talkar cuz in endgame I see people just doing things without actually thinking about what they're doing even Pro players do this even I do this sometimes where you're just mindlessly doing things without even thinking about it where to tarp where to go so I'm going to explain that today fourth is decision- making because decision- making is super important on what you want to do I'm going to show you guys bad decisions that I made and good decisions that I made in the tournament and show you guys what you need to do to make sure you have a better decision I'm going to give you some insight of how to rotate through decision making like oh what should we do here if we're in this situation what should we do here and number five is coping if you guys know me and you guys watch my streams I do not cope maybe sometimes right sometimes I do cope but overall I always make sure when I'm wrong I say it I'll show you literally in a part of my V where I sell and I automatically know that I sold in the end you do not want to sit there and cope to your teammate bro like that's so unlucky it's not unlucky half the time in fortnite is not even luck to be honest like oh you get a far Zone pull brother everyone get far Zone PS you know you got to just make it the best out of it and good players do not cope there's still some tier one players that cope but in general to become a better igl you need to understand what you did wrong so you never do that mistake again because IG Ling there's so many mistakes that can happen and coping will just let you cap your skill level out by not going further than what you could be enough talking let's start with leadership and communication first thing leadership number one thing is your Fragger needs to trust you you need to present yourself where if you call something your Fragger listens and trusts you and you're also confident in your ability to have a good call and also confident in your ability to make sure that even if you make a mistake you know it doesn't matter everyone makes mistakes no one has a perfect tournament no one can have the best calls in every single game cuz it's fortnite bro you don't know what's going to happen things could change your way but in general you want to be making sure that you you have good leadership and you have good communication okay so let's watch this right here and let's just listen to my comps okay pulls up north [ __ ] crickets all right let's go let's go come I'm going to dash far are you good I just slid I just slid I'm just chilling here I'm going to ramp this off perfect example right here Zone pulls iom pulls North and I'm also saying what I'm doing while I'm doing it okay this is so important in communication let's say you're a Fragger and Zone pulls and your 's already leaving but you're like bro you didn't say anything and you get caught lacking behind and now you're split instead of being a Duo what you need is to also make sure beforehand that your Fragger is locked in every time Zone's about to pull you want to talk to your teammate yo Zone's about to pull [ __ ] looking at anything else and worry about rotating right right here I literally come I'm dashing three times literally dashing across he sees me he's following me and I'm also asking if he's good which is perfect perfect literally calming if he's good making sure that he's on me right here too I'm calming everything I'm going to ramp this off get to me are you good literally calms and Leadership literally both together let's keep watching we're to get more Dash right to get the spr I want to go there come beautiful I literally come what I'm thinking and what I want to do I want to get more Dash water in this game getting any more rotation is literally viable and only helpful to you so I'm getting more Dash water I'm thinking what I'm going to do I com it my teammate knows now if he doesn't follow me that's on him if I'm calming and I'm also caling come come come come so he knows when to come to me to get the the dash water to get into Z keep watching I'm going to get water water we're going to have to oh another beautiful C I'm cing my mats before the rotate I'm telling them we're going to have to dash here and what's your mats number one thing is you need to make sure you're good on mats before you can do anything right here I'm cing what I'm going to do and he's going to follow me let's keep playing we wait for Zone open up there's there's no pool in zone tap tap tap tap tap okay perfect right here you see while I'm igiling I'm not looking for kills I'm not looking for a way to get us killed I'm only looking for a way to get us in zone cuz that's the whole point of your job your job as an igl is to get your teammates into Zone with using the least amount of M and not get tagged or getting killed or getting hit so here I'm calming what I want to do we have to wait for Zone to open up because for half it has to open up for us to get in so I'm looking and also making a decision which is another part decision- making right and understanding rotations beautiful it's literally three in one cuz this is leadership communication understanding rotations knowing when Zone opens up top right you see where zones open up and decision making one to go I'm going to go up go up here we're not going to use we're not going to dash okay we're going to dash now though dash now I Dash I'm going to it we're good we're good beautiful out of me this shows beautiful decision- making beautiful leadership and beautiful communication not so much I would say the decision- making like the way I rotated this wasn't great both of us got tagged and we're also on low ground so I should have waited here a little bit more but end in all it was a good rotate not great it was just good because we still got in zone and we're in a good spot to just chill so all we have to do is just stay alive and get in it could have been a lot better but hey that's another point where you have to learn how to get better right and when to not make mistakes but right there on the Fly you see my decision making oh my God if I just fiz jump right here we're going to die so I I literally say we're not going to dash but in the middle I say we have to dash because that's the decision that I made in the moment and it ended up working out even though we don't have dashes and we got hit a little bit it's a little unlucky I mean not unlucky but you get my point you see right there too when I land I say CS so I know what my teammate is doing if he's good if he's not do I have to go help him so many factors that come into it but you need to make sure as an igl you have strong leadership I got in just heal and then we're just going to pop bigs okay cuz each I already have one you can pick it back up you just see my leadership I'm cing what he needs to do and he just listens that's the whole point let's go into the end game now so we're on low ground and we're on a low elevation my head is that we need to get up because being on low ground and Zone pulling far we're going to be griefed so right here I make the decision to not go before Zone closes and wait for it to show the next moving for us to go so I tell MZ to stop fighting no more fighting we're going to sit here we're going to Fizz and we're going to go so watch no no come come come come come come I'm going up I'm going up you get me chill chill I need to now we're in one of the best positions in my opinion because now we're on height where we have a better vision of where everyone's at we have vision over what's going to happen if we can get kills behind us we can look back and if people are stuck on low ground you have a higher chance of getting killed and we're also straight next to moving you guys can see right next to moving we're right here and moving's right here all we have to do is wait and go in late so what I tell us is to just chill we sit here and we're chilling we're in a God Spot okay you can turn let's just sit here we're going to get C kills behind us it pulls back down though okay we're going to have to take it slow we're going to Fizz off yeah fiz it watch behind yeah playing High I'm dropping 30 60 70 so right here literally beautiful we sit we turn around and I'm also being aware of not being able to get jumped on by ramping out our right we're getting fried we look here this would have been kills if I had a scope but I didn't the bloom was unlucky but look you see how we wait we shoot actually on head I'm he died 35 70 140 140 I don't have a I don't have angle I don't have I don't have a DOT on my thing as well let's let's go to Z tap tap tap let's go we need go the hi on left on left watch out I tap I dropped down I dropped downa my box I got out I went out I went out I out just heal just heal just heal I got you 3 beautiful out of me you see how there was someone in my box in front of me and instead of taking a 50/50 for no reason when I have really good Max I take it slow get out I realized that my teammate is low HP and what I have to do is just make a box for him to heal cuz if he goes down right now we're not going to get good game in this is going to be a terrible game if it doesn't go well and also this is our first time playing we don't have Synergy we don't have chemistry this is our first time ever playing we don't know what to do as a Duo cuz we've never played for a longer time this is what I'm saying this is how I'm going to teach you become a better igl because look even playing with people that are new these are the steps that you need to really become a better IG yeah we're going to kill this kid below me after you get that okay yeah yeah pop everything pop everything you need to pop we're going to kill this right in front of me drop down and get dashes real quick no no no no no we're going to kill this first so right here I call while he's healing we're going to take this kid's top kill this kid and then worry about next cuz there's 15 seconds of Zone we're already in but I realized someone places a wall in front of the cone so if we start smacking the cone we're going to get agroed by the team on the wall so I instantly tell my teammate to disengage and we go for Dash's watch all [ __ ] that [ __ ] that my top no we're kill this kill this kill this kill this got it it so right here just shows another miscommunication and bad Synergy because I'm holding and I'm editing while he's trying to edit and he's trying to hold so right there if we play for longer it would be he's holding he edits right and IID just be shooting and we' probably get a free kill but it's fine right this is all based on longevity of playing together right we haven't played that long it is what it is you should just hold you just hold okay I see there's 5 seconds on Zone 30 we wait for next so I wanted to get dashes I I forgot about this game I did want to go that get dashes but I realized that it pulls up again okay so what what I wanted to do is the thing with zones that pull Max or above elevation you need to be the first ones on the hill cuz everyone below the hill is just going to end up getting killed because they're not going to be able to make it out they're going to get suffocated they're going to get jumped on so many problems this is literally understanding of rotations whenever you're below an elevation that wear a PS you need to be the first ones on there because if anything happens below you're suffocated like I just said and you're dead I'm my water ready hold hold on hold so right here we're ahead of Zone and I I realized there's a kid popping a med kit on my wall and also while I'm thinking this we could push this team and use their tarp to get in front cuz they're already above us we need to keep getting up and getting on the hill so watch it hold it on the left get out yeah yeah yeah go go yeah get out go we go up we need go up come come come mantle just mantle I literally just went up I I got up I got I got up I went up one you see right there how we were fighting that duo and we took their tarp and we kept pressuring them and we used their builds to get ahead and then when we saw the opening to go on the hill we both took it we just ran up mantled you could say that's a risky rotate there but 8 times out of 10 it's a good rotate because those kids in the boxes below that you mantle on they're not going to even know you're there because they're worrying about other things and there's 20 other people in the lobby that they have to worry about not just you even if you get hit going up but you're the first ones on here it puts you in a good position and right there on low ground I didn't just stop here right watch I mantled up this was good mantle and I and I just ramped for him thinking that he's on my back so I ramp this off cuz I get shot on my right this guy edit me I have a ramp behind him and then I go out realize it's not my wall so I insta ramp it and then I go up again there's another kid below me I go up again super risky but it ends up working because I'm actually one of the first people on the hill okay I get up it was scuffed but I ended up getting up and what I do is realize that we're almost in all I have to do is get us in and I have armor so and I have to heal so I have to heal get us in and make sure no one could mess with us so I tarp Us in armor everything he drops Minis and then he tarps his head this is perfect and we're also calming our mats which is super important literally we don't even say how many mats you have he Cals it I have 180 mats he has this many Ms Ms I'm your team you're I'm full healing I'm full healing I'm but you see how he's trying to fight a team which is perfect right he's front side he's in zone he can fight if you're in zone you could fight if the next one hasn't pulled yet okay he's fighting and I'm calming that I cannot help him because I'm full healing he knows that so he's making a solo play but you need to have your Fragger make plays like this for yourself and what I'm thinking here is I need more mats I need to heal up and I need to worry about next got any mats I need pop move Mark move Mark I can't see p back come come come come come low ground low ground or not low not low come we need to look for a kill here before oh it's a TR train train train so right here we went front cuz I saw zone pull this was superlucky that the train is in my way even though it shows on the top right the train is over here I don't know what this is this is like a visual Burg or something but right away I calm that the train's coming I get us a little bit ahead and I realized with this train taking over the front nobody's front low ground because no one can build there no one anyone there is probably going to die and what I'm thinking here is like okay train leads we can take front low I need to reload CH tap is tap is tap is we need to get ahead we need get have 12 I have 12 come come out this way let's go I'm rapping I I run front can you get up can you get up here I have zero BS z bus Z bu right here you see me we don't have mats I'm calming how much I have and I'm calming we need to get ahead so I tell to tap F so we can get ahead and I get us in a position where we are elevated above low ground because we already see a team claimed it a metal team that looks stack has claimed lram all we have to do is play our layer out look back when we're in zone and try to get solo refreshes that's the whole point you need to think like this is getting ahead looking back for solos and making sure that you have the timing in between staying ahead and looking for kills cuz you cannot look look for kills if you're back Z you know you only could look if you're ahead smack this smack this smack this hold it hold hold 120 120 back back get get go go go go come come on left come on right right here Hunter kill him come two build two build come come come I have MS I have so many here dropped you I have so many no yeah yeah hold on reloading reloading on the right on the right no right here at the top right here right here dead get that get thato I'm reloading I got it I got out oh I'm I'm one I'm one so right here you guys see that we wait back Zone and and I realized that we need to get ahead we get ahead I see a solo in front of me kill the solo get the loot get us ahead and then M sees a play below and I'm going to trust my Fragger cuz also the way it works is you need to trust both ways the Fragger trusts you and K Call's and you trust the Fragger when he frags so I go down there we get it a kill we get the loot I get out and right here watches yeah come come come I so many so many dropped you dropped you I need Fizz I need a full fiz just hold me please I need a full F so I'm low on HP and I drop him all my heart so he can tarp in for me while he's tarping in and staying ahead I could heal on my own and worry about myself cuz the thing with IG ling you're not the only one tarping and doing things on your own the Fragger needs to be doing his own thing and also knowing when to help you in a Duo it's not just you you need to both play a good part I would say IG Ling is around 75% of the game until you're in end game end game you make the calls but half the time you both need to know what you're doing because you both have to be smart individual players I solo we should fight hide we should try to fight hide here okay yeah I'm looking yeah I can my wall my wall 30 it's my back you kind of need to drop I drop come come come front low front low front low front low front low come come come I need to pop Med though you need to hold me I need to reload as well Dro you dropped you everything nice my w nice get it all get it all I don't have any you need build you need to build slide slide on the ramp slide on the ramp I have MS I have [ __ ] fighting me yeah good you got doubles I have a roof ni one one 100 180 180 180 180 180 Dead 2 look up look up look up he's spray okay okay I can't I can't spray pack no chop it right here right here you see what I'm chopping right here I'm I have two Med kits I can play I can play I see him he hasn't played anything yet and then here we don't end up winning the game top two that's the best placement we could have got but you see right here beforehand before anything happens right right here I basically became the frag cuz he tarps ah head here but right here I'm still the IG because look we're healing we start getting smacked by height okay and I comment we're getting smacked by height my walls gone and I'm like we just need to get ahead what [ __ ] this and I take front low cuz the team on front low staggered right when they stagger in last zones you need to be the team if you're in a midr layer if you see the low ground opportunity to take it you take it and you hold it you are guaranteed a top three in that end game if you still hold it right this team staggered they made a mistake and we capitalized on their mistake I saw it but I'm also calming to Muzz that I need to heal okay and I also need to reload so I drop him on my he calls he has noads and while he's fighting he cracks his kid I see that so what I'm thinking here is I need to I need to just trust him and have my gun out and we need to fight right so right here I have my gun out waiting for him he kills both players and I just had my gun out I would have killed that kid but he was in my way it was unlucky whatever and I C to him to get all the mats cuz I need to start popping Med I called and I pop a med he calls to get underneath the ramp and I have zero builds I have to pop this met out cuz I'm super low this kid start frying me and he's on low ground what I'm thinking here cuz I didn't see the amount of players it's a 2v2 situation so I just have to kill this guy on low ground and just win the fight on height he marks both players and I go up try to get behind this guy kills him I see that instantly so I go up and I'm like okay I'm going to try to kill him I monkey Jam and we just kill this kid and right here we have low ground top two situation right main points from this G end game is literally communication I was my leadership in communication from rotates understanding rotations when to go I did not just stay ahead the whole time I waited tap is and got ahead when I had the chance when I saw the opening where to tarp I tarped in an area where I want a good layer sometimes you don't want to waste mats tarping for no reason sometimes you could box wait go ahead box right and decision-making I made really decisions that end game and some poor ones I would say that rotate to half was a poor decision I would say going up the hill mantling up was a poor decision that was it really that was my poor decisions we had really good decision making besides that understanding it and coping right no coping there's not really to cope about we got second what are we coping on no one sold coping is when it's someone sells but at the end of the day these are literally five steps that could easily help you just become a better igl and a lot of people have been asking me kada how to become a better igl and I'm really trying to tell you it's not that hard you just need to find someone that has that
